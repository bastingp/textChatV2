BOOK: THE SONNETS 
But as the riper should by time decease, 
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, 
And only herald to the gaudy spring, 
Pity the world, or else this glutton be, 
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. 
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; 
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, 
Now is the time that face should form another, 
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. 
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? 
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb, 
Calls back the lovely April of her prime, 
The bounteous largess given thee to give? 
Which used lives th' executor to be. 
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell 
Will play the tyrants to the very same, 
Which happies those that pay the willing loan; 
Lo in the orient when the gracious light 
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill, 
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day, 
The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are 
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, 
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear: 
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife, 
The world will be thy widow and still weep, 
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend 
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; 
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end, 
And kept unused the user so destroys it: 
If all were minded so, the times should cease, 
And threescore year would make the world away: 
When I do count the clock that tells the time, 
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night, 
When I behold the violet past prime, 
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd 
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: 
That thou among the wastes of time must go, 
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day 
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck, 
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment. 
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky: 
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay, 
Now stand you on the top of happy hours, 
So should the lines of life that life repair 
If I could write the beauty of your eyes, 
The age to come would say this poet lies, 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws, 
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood, 
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws, 
And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood, 
To the wide world and all her fading sweets: 
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion, 
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, 
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart, 
As an unperfect actor on the stage, 
The perfect ceremony of love's rite, 
O let my looks be then the eloquence, 
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled, 
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held, 
For through the painter must you see his skill, 
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun 
They draw but what they see, know not the heart. 
But as the marigold at the sun's eye, 
The painful warrior famoused for fight, 
Is from the book of honour razed quite, 
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled: 
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired, 
Looking on darkness which the blind do see. 
That am debarred the benefit of rest? 
The one by toil, the other to complain 
I tell the day to please him thou art bright, 
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: 
So flatter I the swart-complexioned night, 
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even. 
(Like to the lark at break of day arising 
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought, 
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, 
And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight. 
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, 
But if the while I think on thee (dear friend) 
As interest of the dead, which now appear, 
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live, 
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, 
And thou (all they) hast all the all of me. 
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time, 
Exceeded by the height of happier men. 
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, 
Kissing with golden face the meadows green; 
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride, 
And from the forlorn world his visage hide 
The region cloud hath masked him from me now. 
Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth. 
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, 
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, 
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: 
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss, 
Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief 
To him that bears the strong offence's cross. 
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me, 
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth 
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise. 
When thou art all the better part of me? 
To entertain the time with thoughts of love, 
But here's the joy, my friend and I are one, 
For all the day they view things unrespected, 
To the clear day with thy much clearer light, 
By looking on thee in the living day, 
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, 
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee, 
As soon as think the place where he would be. 
The other two, slight air, and purging fire, 
The first my thought, the other my desire, 
How to divide the conquest of thy sight, 
My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right, 
But the defendant doth that plea deny, 
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, 
The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part. 
And each doth good turns now unto the other, 
And to the painted banquet bids my heart: 
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief. 
Within the gentle closure of my breast, 
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear, 
When love converted from the thing it was 
Within the knowledge of mine own desert, 
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part, 
To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws, 
How heavy do I journey on the way, 
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.' 
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe, 
As if by some instinct the wretch did know 
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on, 
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence, 
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence? 
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind, 
So am I as the rich whose blessed key, 
The which he will not every hour survey, 
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. 
Or captain jewels in the carcanet. 
So is the time that keeps you as my chest 
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, 
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit, 
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year, 
The one doth shadow of your beauty show, 
The other as your bounty doth appear, 
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem 
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye, 
As the perfumed tincture of the roses, 
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments 
And broils root out the work of masonry, 
The living record of your memory. 
Even in the eyes of all posterity 
That wear this world out to the ending doom. 
So till the judgment that your self arise, 
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness: 
Let this sad interim like the ocean be 
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new, 
Come daily to the banks, that when they see: 
Return of love, more blest may be the view. 
Upon the hours, and times of your desire? 
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour, 
Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you, 
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour, 
Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave, 
Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty, 
The second burthen of a former child! 
Even of five hundred courses of the sun, 
That I might see what the old world could say, 
Or whether revolution be the same. 
O sure I am the wits of former days, 
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, 
Nativity once in the main of light, 
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, 
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow, 
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth, 
My heavy eyelids to the weary night? 
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy? 
To play the watchman ever for thy sake. 
Stealing away the treasure of his spring: 
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age, 
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain 
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, 
And the firm soil win of the watery main, 
Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days, 
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, 
Before the golden tresses of the dead, 
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away, 
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view, 
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend: 
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due, 
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown. 
They look into the beauty of thy mind, 
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: 
The soil is this, that thou dost common grow. 
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair, 
The ornament of beauty is suspect, 
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time, 
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, 
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days, 
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell 
Give warning to the world that I am fled 
The hand that writ it, for I love you so, 
Lest the wise world should look into your moan, 
O lest the world should task you to recite, 
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, 
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. 
In me thou seest the twilight of such day, 
As after sunset fadeth in the west, 
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire, 
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, 
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire, 
The very part was consecrate to thee, 
The earth can have but earth, which is his due, 
My spirit is thine the better part of me, 
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, 
The prey of worms, my body being dead, 
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife, 
The worth of that, is that which it contains, 
Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground; 
And for the peace of you I hold such strife 
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure, 
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure, 
Why with the time do I not glance aside 
Why write I still all one, ever the same, 
For as the sun is daily new and old, 
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show, 
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing, 
Have added feathers to the learned's wing, 
In others' works thou dost but mend the style, 
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen, 
And in the praise thereof spends all his might, 
But since your worth (wide as the ocean is) 
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, 
The worst was this, my love was my decay. 
Though I (once gone) to all the world must die, 
The earth can yield me but a common grave, 
When all the breathers of this world are dead, 
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men. 
The dedicated words which writers use 
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days. 
In whose confine immured is the store, 
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed. 
And to the most of praise add something more, 
Then others, for the breath of words respect, 
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse, 
Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you, 
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? 
I was not sick of any fear from thence. 
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing: 
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, 
And place my merit in the eye of scorn, 
The injuries that to my self I do, 
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross, 
join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, 
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe, 
But in the onset come, so shall I taste 
At first the very worst of fortune's might. 
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest, 
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs, 
When in the least of them my life hath end, 
In many's looks, the false heart's history 
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell. 
That do not do the thing, they most do show, 
Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces, 
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, 
The basest weed outbraves his dignity: 
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame, 
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose, 
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name! 
That tongue that tells the story of thy days, 
The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge. 
As on the finger of a throned queen, 
The basest jewel will be well esteemed: 
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray, 
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state! 
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! 
The teeming autumn big with rich increase, 
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, 
And thou away, the very birds are mute. 
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near. 
From you have I been absent in the spring, 
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell 
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white, 
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose, 
The forward violet thus did I chide, 
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride 
The lily I condemned for thy hand, 
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand, 
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem, 
I love not less, though less the show appear, 
The owner's tongue doth publish every where. 
Our love was new, and then but in the spring, 
Not that the summer is less pleasant now 
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, 
The argument all bare is of more worth 
To mar the subject that before was well? 
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride, 
In process of the seasons have I seen, 
When in the chronicle of wasted time, 
I see descriptions of the fairest wights, 
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, 
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul, 
Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come, 
Can yet the lease of my true love control, 
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured, 
And the sad augurs mock their own presage, 
Now with the drops of this most balmy time, 
What's in the brain that ink may character, 
I must each day say o'er the very same, 
Weighs not the dust and injury of age, 
Finding the first conceit of love there bred, 
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged, 
And made my self a motley to the view, 
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, 
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, 
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, 
And almost thence my nature is subdued 
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand: 
Your love and pity doth th' impression fill, 
You are my all the world, and I must strive, 
That all the world besides methinks are dead. 
For it no form delivers to the heart 
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part, 
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight, 
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature, 
The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night: 
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature. 
Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery? 
O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, 
And to his palate doth prepare the cup. 
If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin, 
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents, 
Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things: 
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest? 
Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
Or bends with the remover to remove. 
It is the star to every wand'ring bark, 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom: 
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds 
Bring me within the level of your frown, 
The constancy and virtue of your love. 
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured, 
But thence I learn and find the lesson true, 
In the distraction of this madding fever! 
The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits! 
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed, 
Or at the least, so long as brain and heart 
Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past, 
If my dear love were but the child of state, 
Under the blow of thralled discontent, 
Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls: 
To this I witness call the fools of time, 
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy, 
With my extern the outward honouring, 
In the old age black was not counted fair, 
Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face, 
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds, 
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand, 
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand. 
Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame 
On purpose laid to make the taker mad. 
All this the world well knows yet none knows well, 
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. 
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun, 
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. 
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. 
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. 
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan; 
And thence this slander as I think proceeds. 
And truly not the morning sun of heaven 
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, 
Nor that full star that ushers in the even 
Doth half that glory to the sober west 
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, 
He pays the whole, and yet am I not free. 
The sea all water, yet receives rain still, 
'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love, 
Then in the number let me pass untold, 
Yet what the best is, take the worst to be. 
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride, 
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied? 
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place? 
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties. 
Although she knows my days are past the best, 
O call not me to justify the wrong, 
The manner of my pity-wanting pain. 
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, 
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay: 
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind. 
The better angel is a man right fair: 
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill. 
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate', 
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth, 
For that which longer nurseth the disease, 
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, 
Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please: 
My reason the physician to my love, 
At random from the truth vainly expressed. 
What means the world to say it is not so? 
The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears. 
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes? 
To make me give the lie to my true sight, 
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day? 
That in the very refuse of thy deeds, 
The more I hear and see just cause of hate? 
Or made them swear against the thing they see. 
To swear against the truth so foul a be. 
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast, 
I sick withal the help of bath desired, 
But found no cure, the bath for my help lies, 
The little Love-god lying once asleep, 
The fairest votary took up that fire, 
And so the general of hot desire,

Is this the man you speak of? 
Not fearing the displeasure of your master, 
KING. Come, come, to th' purpose. Did he love this woman? 
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, 
And now behold the meaning. 
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? 
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see, 
The name and not the thing. 
To make the even truth in pleasure flow. 
Of that and all the progress, more and less, 
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet. [Flourish] 
KING. The King's a beggar, now the play is done.

BOOK: THE TRAGEDY OF ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
The Roman Empire 
O'erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes, 
That o'er the files and musters of the war 
The office and devotion of their view 
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst 
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper, 
And is become the bellows and the fan 
Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her LADIES, the train, 
The triple pillar of the world transform'd 
ANTONY. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd. 
ANTONY. Grates me the sum. 
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent 
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's Queen, 
When shrill-tongu'd Fulvia scolds. The messengers! 
ANTONY. Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch 
Of the rang'd empire fall! Here is my space. 
Feeds beast as man. The nobleness of life 
On pain of punishment, the world to weet 
I'll seem the fool I am not. Antony 
Now for the love of Love and her soft hours, 
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh; 
CLEOPATRA. Hear the ambassadors. 
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note 
The qualities of people. Come, my queen; 
Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, with the train 
That he approves the common liar, who 
most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer that you prais'd so 
to th' Queen? O that I knew this husband, which you say must 
CHARMIAN. Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things? 
ENOBARBUS. Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough 
SOOTHSAYER. You shall outlive the lady whom you serve. 
CHARMIAN. E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine. 
worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow 
IRAS. Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as 
CHARMIAN. Not he; the Queen. 
CLEOPATRA. He was dispos'd to mirth; but on the sudden 
Exeunt CLEOPATRA, ENOBARBUS, and the rest 
MESSENGER. Fulvia thy wife first came into the field. 
But soon that war had end, and the time's state 
Whose better issue in the war from Italy 
Upon the first encounter drave them. 
MESSENGER. The nature of bad news infects the teller. 
ANTONY. When it concerns the fool or coward. On! 
ANTONY. Speak to me home; mince not the general tongue; 
ANTONY. From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there! 
FIRST ATTENDANT. The man from Sicyon- is there such an one? 
Importeth thee to know, this bears. [Gives the letter] 
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure, 
The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone; 
The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on. 
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know, 
unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death's the 
the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die 
ENOBARBUS. Alack, sir, no! Her passions are made of nothing but the 
ENOBARBUS. Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it 
pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it 
shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein that 
and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown'd with 
indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow. 
ANTONY. The business she hath broached in the state 
ENOBARBUS. And the business you have broach'd here cannot be 
The cause of our expedience to the Queen, 
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, 
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters to 
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands 
The empire of the sea; our slippery people, 
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver 
Pompey the Great and all his dignities 
For the main soldier; whose quality, going on, 
The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding 
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life 
You do not hold the method to enforce 
The like from him. 
CLEOPATRA. Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him. 
It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature 
ANTONY. What's the matter? 
What says the married woman? You may go. 
ANTONY. The gods best know- 
So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first 
I saw the treasons planted. 
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods, 
Then was the time for words. No going then! 
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, 
Art turn'd the greatest liar. 
The strong necessity of time commands 
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome; 
Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength, 
Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey, 
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived 
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; 
The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best. 
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill 
The purposes I bear; which are, or cease, 
As you shall give th' advice. By the fire 
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears 
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian, 
The carriage of his chafe. 
To bear such idleness so near the heart 
And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword 
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes 
The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike 
Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy 
A man who is the abstract of all faults 
His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven, 
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy, 
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave, 
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet 
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones 
That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports 
The discontents repair, and men's reports 
It hath been taught us from the primal state 
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love, 
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, 
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide, 
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound 
They make in Italy; the borders maritime 
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle 
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge; 
Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets, 
The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps 
Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end 
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony! 
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm 
When thou wast here above the ground, I was 
He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses- 
CLEOPATRA. Mine ear must pluck it thence. 
'Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends 
To mend the petty present, I will piece 
Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East, 
ALEXAS. Like to the time o' th' year between the extremes 
Note him, good Charmian; 'tis the man; but note him! 
The violence of either thee becomes, 
Say 'the brave Antony.' 
CHARMIAN. The valiant Caesar!

The deeds of justest men. 
The thing we sue for.

Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love, 
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,

The higher our opinion, that our stirring 
Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck 
The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony. 
To draw their swords. But how the fear of us

upon the river of Cydnus. 
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, 
Burn'd on the water. The poop was beaten gold; 
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that 
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, 
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made 
The water which they beat to follow faster, 
The fancy out-work nature. On each side her 
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, 
ENOBARBUS. Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, 
So many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes, 
And made their bends adornings. At the helm 
A seeming mermaid steers. The silken tackle 
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands 
That yarely frame the office. From the barge 
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense 
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast 
Enthron'd i' th' market-place, did sit alone, 
Whistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy, 
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak, 
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, 
Hop forty paces through the public street; 
The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry 
Become themselves in her, that the holy priests

Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers 
Read not my blemishes in the world's report. 
Shall all be done by th' rule. Good night, dear lady. 
SOOTHSAYER. Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither! 
He beats thee 'gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens 
He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him; 
His cocks do win the battle still of mine, 
I' th' East my pleasure lies. 
As I conceive the journey, be at th' Mount 
ALL. The music, ho! 
Enter MARDIAN the eunuch 
The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now. 
Give me mine angle- we'll to th' river. There, 
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed, 
To say the dead are well. Bring it to that, 
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour 
The good precedence; fie upon 'but yet'! 
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear, 
The good and bad together. He's friends with Caesar; 
MESSENGER. For the best turn i' th' bed. 
CLEOPATRA. The most infectious pestilence upon thee! 
I that do bring the news made not the match. 
And make thy fortunes proud. The blow thou hadst 
The man is innocent. 
CLEOPATRA. Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt. 
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again. 
Have given myself the cause. 
Enter the MESSENGER again 
CLEOPATRA. The gods confound thee! Dost thou hold there still? 
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome 
Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him 
Report the feature of Octavia, her years, 
The colour of her hair. Bring me word quickly. 
The other way's a Mars. [To MARDIAN] 
The senators alone of this great world, 
Chief factors for the gods: I do not know 
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted, 
Made the all-honour'd honest Roman, Brutus, 
With the arm'd rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom, 
To drench the Capitol, but that they would 
The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant 
To scourge th' ingratitude that despiteful Rome 
But since the cuckoo builds not for himself, 
For this is from the present- how you take 
The offers we have sent you. 
CAESAR. There's the point. 
Rid all the sea of pirates; then to send 
The praise of it by telling, you must know, 
ANTONY. The beds i' th' East are soft; and thanks to you, 
CAESAR. That's the next to do. 
POMPEY. No, Antony, take the lot; 
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar 
ALL. Show's the way, sir. 
MENAS. True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus. 
ENOBARBUS. But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius. 
MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage 
than the love of the parties. 
ENOBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems 
to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of 
will to his Egyptian dish again; then shall the sighs of Octavia 
blow the fire up in Caesar, and, as I said before, that which is 
the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of 
ill-rooted already; the least wind i' th' world will blow them 
SECOND SERVANT. As they pinch one another by the disposition, he

FIRST SERVANT. But it raises the greater war between him and his 
to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be, which pitifully 
disaster the cheeks. 
ANTONY. [To CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o' th' 
By certain scales i' th' pyramid; they know 
By th' height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth 
Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells 
The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman 
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain, 
LEPIDUS. Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the 
LEPIDUS. Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies' pyramises are 
organs. It lives by that which nourisheth it, and the elements 
ANTONY. 'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet. 
ANTONY. With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very 
MENAS. [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear 
aside] The matter? 
MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of all the world? 
MENAS. Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice. 
And though you think me poor, I am the man 
Will give thee all the world. 
MENAS. No, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup. 
Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove; 
Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips 
Are in thy vessel. Let me cut the cable; 
POMPEY. Fill till the cup be hid. 
[Pointing to the servant who carries off LEPIDUS] 
ENOBARBUS. 'A bears the third part of the world, man; see'st not? 
MENAS. The third part, then, is drunk. Would it were all, 
ENOBARBUS. Drink thou; increase the reels. 
ANTONY. It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho! 
ANTONY. Be a child o' th' time. 
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals 
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense 
Make battery to our ears with the loud music, 
The while I'll place you; then the boy shall sing; 
The holding every man shall bear as loud

Come, thou monarch of the vine, 
Cup us till the world go round, 
Cup us till the world go round!

Splits what it speaks. The wild disguise hath almost

Come, down into the boat. 
and other Romans, OFFICERS and soldiers; the dead body 
Make me revenger. Bear the King's son's body 
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media, 
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither 
The routed fly. So thy grand captain, Antony, 
Which he achiev'd by th' minute, lost his favour. 
Who does i' th' wars more than his captain can 
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss 
Without the which a soldier and his sword 
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia 
We have jaded out o' th' field. 
The weight we must convey with's will permit, 
AGRIPPA. What, are the brothers parted? 
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps 
With the green sickness. 
ENOBARBUS. Caesar? Why he's the Jupiter of men. 
AGRIPPA. What's Antony? The god of Jupiter. 
ENOBARBUS. Spake you of Caesar? How! the nonpareil! 
Let not the piece of virtue which is set 
Betwixt us as the cement of our love 
To keep it builded be the ram to batter 
The fortress of it; for better might we 
Though you be therein curious, the least cause 
For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you, 
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends! 
The elements be kind to thee and make 
ANTONY. The April's in her eyes. It is love's spring, 
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful. 
Her heart inform her tongue- the swan's down feather, 
That stands upon the swell at the full of tide, 
ENOBARBUS. [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that, were he a 
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not 
And give you to the gods. 
LEPIDUS. Let all the number of the stars give light 
CLEOPATRA. Where is the fellow? 
Enter the MESSENGER as before 
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led 
The fellow has good judgment. 
CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. 
CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know. 
When the best hint was given him, he not took't, 
The good gods will mock me presently 
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way 
Yourself shall go between's. The meantime, lady, 
I'll raise the preparation of a war 
The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak, 
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men 
Should solder up the rift. 
ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the success? 
EROS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, 
presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the 
glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters 
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine. 
And throw between them all the food thou hast, 
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony? 
EROS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns 
The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!' 
And threats the throat of that his officer 
In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't: 
I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd, 
Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat 
And all the unlawful issue that their lust 
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her 
MAECENAS. This in the public eye? 
CAESAR. I' th' common show-place, where they exercise. 
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings: 
In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis 
CAESAR. The people knows it, and have now receiv'd 
His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me 
That Lepidus of the triumvirate 
Demand the like. 
Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony 
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach 
Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way 
Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust 
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven, 
The ostentation of our love, which left unshown 
And his affairs come to me on the wind. 
The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled 
Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus 
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; 
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with 
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives 
Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods, 
Only th' adulterous Antony, most large 
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear 
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' th' war, 
And, as the president of my kingdom, will 
Here comes the Emperor. 
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea, 
Than by the negligent. 
Which might have well becom'd the best of men 
The absolute soldiership you have by land; 
The way which promises assurance; and 
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium 
Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail, 
MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried; 
This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians 
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we 
Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth 
SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right. 
Not in the power on't. So our leader's led, 
The legions and the horse whole, do you not? 
CANIDIUS. Well I know the man. 
MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius. 
CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth 
The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies 
Another part of the plain 
ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill, 
We may the number of the ships behold, 
Another part of the plain 
over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of 
CAESAR, the other way. After their going in is heard 
the noise of a sea-fight 
Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral, 
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder. 
All the whole synod of them! 
SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost 
ENOBARBUS. How appears the fight? 
SCARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence, 
Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight, 
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder- 
The breese upon her, like a cow in June- 
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not 
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, 
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her. 
CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath, 
Show me the way of yielding. 
The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason 
Sits in the wind against me. Exeunt 
ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't; 
I am so lated in the world that I 
My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O, 
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white 
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them 
Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint 
Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way. 
The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I 
That the mad Brutus ended; he alone 
In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no matter. 
EROS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen! 
EROS. Most noble sir, arise; the Queen approaches. 
Your comfort makes the rescue. 
EROS. Sir, the Queen. 
My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings, 
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods 
To the young man send humble treaties, dodge 
And palter in the shifts of lowness, who 
With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd, 
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf 
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth, 
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, 
I have no ears to his request. The Queen 
CAESAR. Bring him through the bands. Exit EUPHRONIUS 
The ne'er-touch'd vestal. Try thy cunning, Thyreus; 
The itch of his affection should not then 
When half to half the world oppos'd, he being 
The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less 
Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY 
ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she 
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head, 
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim 
ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose 
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note 
Under the service of a child as soon 
As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore 
Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show 
Do draw the inward quality after them, 
Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will 
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose 
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir. Exit SERVANT 
The loyalty well held to fools does make 
And earns a place i' th' story. 
THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he 
The universal landlord. 
The doom of Egypt. 
If that the former dare but what it can, 
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest 
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries 
So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name 
Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall 
Forborne the getting of a lawful race, 
O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes, 
Upon the hill of Basan to outroar 
The horned herd! For I have savage cause, 
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank 
The white hand of a lady fever thee! 
Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike 
The fall of Antony. 
And poison it in the source, and the first stone 
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite! 
Till by degrees the memory of my womb, 
By the discandying of this pelleted storm, 
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile 
If from the field I shall return once more 
Let's mock the midnight bell. 
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen, 
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight 
ENOBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious 
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still 
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek 
Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know 
Know that to-morrow the last of many battles 
And feast the army; we have store to do't, 
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony! Exeunt 
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood 
Out of the mind. 
SERVANT. The gods forbid! 
May be it is the period of your duty. 
And the gods yield you for't! 
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus! 
FIRST SOLDIER. Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day. 
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets? 
[The two companies separate and place themselves 
in every corner of the stage] 
[Music of the hautboys is under the stage] 
THIRD SOLDIER. Music i' th' air. 
FOURTH SOLDIER. Under the earth. 
SECOND SOLDIER. 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd, 
FIRST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter; 
The armourer of my heart. False, false; this, this. 
The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see 
And at the port expect you. 
CAPTAIN. The morn is fair. Good morrow, General. 
This morning, like the spirit of a youth 
SOLDIER. The gods make this a happy day to Antony! 
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier 
CAESAR. Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight. 
CAESAR. The time of universal peace is near. 
Prove this a prosp'rous day, the three-nook'd world 
Shall bear the olive freely. 
Is come into the field. 
Plant those that have revolted in the vant, 
Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest 
His bounty overplus. The messenger 
I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer 
Out of the host. I must attend mine office, 
ENOBARBUS. I am alone the villain of the earth, 
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits 
Field of battle between the camps 
Under the walls of Alexandria 
And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow, 
Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood 
Not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been 
Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends, 
Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss 
The honour'd gashes whole. 
Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o' th' world, 
Ride on the pants triumphing. 
The world's great snare uncaught? 
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them. 
Had our great palace the capacity 
And drink carouses to the next day's fate, 
With brazen din blast you the city's ear; 
We must return to th' court of guard. The night 
By th' second hour i' th' morn. 
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me, 
Against the flint and hardness of my fault, 
But let the world rank me in register 
CENTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks 
CENTURION. The hand of death hath raught him. 
[Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums 
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him 
To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour 
He may recover yet. Exeunt with the body 
Between the two camps 
ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air; 
Upon the hills adjoining to the city 
They have put forth the haven- 
Between the camps 
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales, 
In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers 
My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder 
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts 
Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss. 
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians; 
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot 
The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me, 
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon, 
And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club 
Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die. 
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall 
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly 
The soul and body rive not more in parting 
CLEOPATRA. To th' monument! 
Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony' 
And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument! 
With trees upon't that nod unto the world 
The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct, 
I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen- 
She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death. 
Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake 
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break 
The name of Antony; it was divided 
ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done, 
The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep 
The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides! 
All length is torture. Since the torch is out, 
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze. 
And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros! 
I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods 
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back 
The courage of a woman; less noble mind 
That, when the exigent should come- which now 
Th' inevitable prosecution of 
Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come. 
EROS. The gods withhold me! 
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts, 
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat 
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies. 
The thing why thou hast drawn it. 
EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow 
The guard, ho! O, dispatch me! 
FIRST GUARD. What's the noise? 
SECOND GUARD. The star is fall'n. 
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come, 
DIOMEDES. What, ho! the Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho! 
Enter four or five of the guard of ANTONY 
'Tis the last service that I shall command you. 
Look out o' th' other side your monument; 
Enter, below, ANTONY, borne by the guard 
Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling stand 
The varying shore o' th' world. O Antony, 
Of many thousand kisses the poor last 
Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show 
Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever shall 
That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power, 
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up, 
That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel, 
ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end 
Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world, 
The noblest; and do now not basely die, 
The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord! 
O, wither'd is the garland of the war, 
The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls 
Are level now with men. The odds is gone, 
Beneath the visiting moon. [Swoons] 
By such poor passion as the maid that milks 
And does the meanest chares. It were for me 
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods; 
To rush into the secret house of death 
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion, 
But resolution and the briefest end. 
The pauses that he makes. 
Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY 
CAESAR. The breaking of so great a thing should make 
A greater crack. The round world 
And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony 
Is not a single doom; in the name lay 
A moiety of the world. 
Which writ his honour in the acts it did 
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it, 
Splitted the heart. This is his sword; 
The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings 
To wash the eyes of kings. 
In the whole world. But yet let me lament, 
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts, 
Friend and companion in the front of war, 
The arm of mine own body, and the heart 
The business of this man looks out of him; 
EGYPTIAN. A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress, 
To th' way she's forc'd to. 
EGYPTIAN. So the gods preserve thee! Exit 
The quality of her passion shall require, 
Alexandria. The monument 
Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug, 
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's. 
Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS, 
PROCULEIUS. Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt, 
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn 
Look him i' th' face. 
Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the 
and come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the guard 
unbar and open the gates 
Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see 
Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye 
And show me to the shouting varletry 
Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies 
And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen, 
CLEOPATRA. His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck 
The little O, the earth. 
CLEOPATRA. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm 
Crested the world. His voice was propertied 
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends; 
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, 
That grew the more by reaping. His delights 
The element they liv'd in. In his livery 
CLEOPATRA. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods. 
It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff 
As answering to the weight. Would I might never 
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites 
CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt? 
DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam. [CLEOPATPA kneels] 
CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods 
The record of what injuries you did us, 
CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o' th' world, 
CLEOPATRA. And may, through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we, 
CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels, 
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus. 
Your wisdom in the deed. 
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does 
Doing the honour of thy lordliness 
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by 
With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me 
Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence; 
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits 
Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man, 
CLEOPATRA. Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought 
Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours, 
IRAS. Finish, good lady; the bright day is done, 
And we are for the dark. 
Go put it to the haste. 
DOLABELLA. Where's the Queen? 
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths, 
IRAS. The gods forbid! 
Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians 
I' th' posture of a whore. 
IRAS. O the good gods! 
CLEOPATRA. Why, that's the way

And churlish chiding of the winter's wind, 
Sweet are the uses of adversity, 
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, 
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, 
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune 
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, 
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that; 
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood! 
To the which place a poor sequest'red stag, 
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, 
The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans 
Almost to bursting; and the big round tears 
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, 
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, 
Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,

Full of the pasture, jumps along by him

Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, 
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, 
Seeking the bubble reputation 
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, 
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts

A hall in the DUKE'S palace 
Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchant 
And by the doom of death end woes and all. 
The enmity and discord which of late 
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke 
For, since the mortal and intestine jars 
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, 
Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies, 
His goods confiscate to the Duke's dispose, 
To quit the penalty and to ransom him. 
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, 
My woes end likewise with the evening sun. 
DUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause 
Yet, that the world may witness that my end 
And the great care of goods at random left, 
The pleasing punishment that women bear, 
And, which was strange, the one so like the other 
That very hour, and in the self-same inn, 
Before the always-wind-obeying deep 
For what obscured light the heavens did grant 
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife, 
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes, 
The sailors sought for safety by our boat, 
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us; 
My wife, more careful for the latter-born, 
To him one of the other twins was bound, 
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other. 
The children thus dispos'd, my wife and I, 
Fast'ned ourselves at either end the mast, 
And, floating straight, obedient to the stream, 
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, 
And, by the benefit of his wished light, 
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered

For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,

And wander up and down to view the city.

The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit; 
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell- 
She is so hot because the meat is cold, 
The meat is cold because you come not home, 
Where have you left the money that I gave you? 
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper? 
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not. 
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money? 
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner. 
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

The villain is o'erraught of all my money.

The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands; 
One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell. 
ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter; he is rested on the case. 
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk? 
ADRIANA. What, the chain? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; 'tis time that I were gone. 
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one. 
ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear. 
If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way, 
ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight, 
The mart 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me 
for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell'd? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise, 
but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the 
calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind 
went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; 
hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and 
then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to tarry for the 
boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I; 
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now. 
Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day? 
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's 
dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and 
thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me!' That's 
that must eat with the devil. 
COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner, 
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd, 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, 
The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it. 
COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain; 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly pride' says the peacock. Mistress, that you know. 
And for the same he promis'd me a chain; 
The reason that I gather he is mad, 
On purpose shut the doors against his way. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER 
And will not lightly trust the messenger. 
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.

I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven. 
Did this companion with the saffron face 
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut, 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence? 
That since have felt the vigour of his rage. 
PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein, 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness 
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold? 
PINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him. 
The debt he owes will be requir'd of me. 
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it. 
Be mad, good master; cry 'The devil!' 
ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes? 
The ring I saw upon his finger now- 
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is; 
I long to know the truth hereof at large.

ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man? 
And much different from the man he was; 
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing. 
ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last; 
ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference. 
Alone, it was the subject of my theme; 
ABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad. 
The venom clamours of a jealous woman 
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred; 
The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits 
Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits. 
Till I have us'd the approved means I have, 
To separate the husband and the wife. 
LUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity. 
And take perforce my husband from the Abbess. 
SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five; 
Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person 
Comes this way to the melancholy vale, 
The place of death and sorry execution, 
Behind the ditches of the abbey here. 
Against the laws and statutes of this town, 
LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey. 
Enter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded; 
with the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS 
If any friend will pay the sum for him, 
ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess! 
That desp'rately he hurried through the street, 
Doing displeasure to the citizens 
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence 
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went, 
He broke from those that had the guard of him, 
And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us, 
To do him all the grace and good I could. 
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate, 
And bid the Lady Abbess come to me, 
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor, 
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair. 
My master preaches patience to him, and the while 
Between them they will kill the conjurer. 
Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here, 
Even for the service that long since I did thee, 
When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took 
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood 
AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote, 
Even in the strength and height of injury. 
Beyond imagination is the wrong 
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me, 
In this the madman justly chargeth them. 
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, 
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, 
I went to seek him. In the street I met him, 
That I this day of him receiv'd the chain, 
Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which 
Then fairly I bespoke the officer 
By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more 
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence, 
These people saw the chain about his neck. 
Heard you confess you had the chain of him, 
After you first forswore it on the mart; 
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven! 
You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine. 
DUKE. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here? 
DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the Abbess hither.

And pay the sum that may deliver me. 
And all the conduits of my blood froze up, 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in 
the city Can witness with me that it is not so: 
Re-enter the ABBESS, with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
DUKE. One of these men is genius to the other; 
And so of these. Which is the natural man, 
And which the spirit? Who deciphers them? 
Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man 
O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak, 
And speak unto the same Aemilia! 
That floated with thee on the fatal raft? 
And the twin Dromio, all were taken up; 
These are the parents to these children, 
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me. 
ABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains 
To go with us into the abbey here, 
The Duke, my husband, and my children both, 
And you the calendars of their nativity,

Rebell'd against the belly; thus accus'd it: 
I' th' midst o' th' body, idle and unactive, 
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing 
Like labour with the rest; where th' other instruments

Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-

Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus- 
For look you, I may make the belly smile

Because I am the storehouse and the shop

Even to the court, the heart, to th' seat o' th' brain; 
And, through the cranks and offices of man, 
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins

That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, 
That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you, 
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you, 
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice 
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is

You cry against the noble Senate, who, 
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else

By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows

We cannot keep the town.

MENENIUS. The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleas'd 
That you do speak to the people. 
Put on the gown, stand naked, and entreat them 
SICINIUS. Sir, the people 
Pray you go fit you to the custom, and 
Be taken from the people. 
Show them th' unaching scars which I should hide,

SEVENTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him 
joy, and make him good friend to the people! 
MENENIUS. You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes 
Endue you with the people's voice. Remains 
That, in th' official marks invested, you 
Anon do meet the Senate. 
SICINIUS. The custom of request you have discharg'd. 
The people do admit you, and are summon'd 
CORIOLANUS. Where? At the Senate House? 
Repair to th' Senate House. 
BRUTUS. We stay here for the people. 
His humble weeds. Will you dismiss the people? 
BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may deserve your loves. 
But was a petty servant to the state, 
Your liberties and the charters that you bear 
I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving 
A place of potency and sway o' th' state, 
Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might 
You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler 
Against the rectorship of judgment? 
Ere now denied the asker, and now again, 
With what contempt he wore the humble weed; 
Th' apprehension of his present portance, 
After the inveterate hate he bears you. 
Than what you should, made you against the grain 
To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us. 
The noble house o' th' Marcians; from whence came 
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, 
Twice being by the people chosen censor, 
Repair to th' Capitol.

SICINIUS. To th' Capitol, come. 
We will be there before the stream o' th' people; 
Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the GENTRY, COMINIUS, 
CORIOLANUS. So then the Volsces stand but as at first, 
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely 
Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium. 
That of all things upon the earth he hated 
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, 
The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them, 
MENENIUS. The matter? 
COMINIUS. Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common? 
FIRST SENATOR. Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place. 
BRUTUS. The people are incens'd against him. 
To curb the will of the nobility; 
The people cry you mock'd them; and of late, 
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them 
For which the people stir; if you will pass 
COMINIUS. The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring 
I' th' plain way of his merit. 
For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them 
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, 
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, 
The very way to catch them. 
BRUTUS. You speak o' th' people 
We let the people know't. 
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, 
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you 
COMINIUS. 'Twas from the canon. 
The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit 
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste 
It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches 
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take 
The one by th' other. 
COMINIUS. Well, on to th' market-place. 
The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd 
CORIOLANUS. Though there the people had more absolute pow'r- 
The ruin of the state. 
BRUTUS. Why shall the people give 
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn 
They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war 
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd, 
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service 
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war, 
Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation 
Which they have often made against the Senate, 
All cause unborn, could never be the native 
The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express 
We are the greater poll, and in true fear 
The nature of our seats, and make the rabble 
Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in 
The crows to peck the eagles. 
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other 
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no 
Real necessities, and give way the while 
That love the fundamental part of state 
More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer 
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick 
The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour 
Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state 
Not having the power to do the good it would, 
For th' ill which doth control't. 
What should the people do with these bald tribunes, 
To the greater bench? In a rebellion, 
And throw their power i' th' dust. 
BRUTUS. The aediles, ho! 
SICINIUS. Go call the people, [Exit AEDILE] in whose name myself 
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee, 
Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES 
To th' people- Coriolanus, patience! 
This is the way to kindle, not to quench. 
FIRST SENATOR. To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat. 
SICINIUS. What is the city but the people? 
The people are the city. 
BRUTUS. By the consent of all we were establish'd 
The people's magistrates. 
COMINIUS. That is the way to lay the city flat, 
To bring the roof to the foundation, 
Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power 
Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence 
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him 
And bear him to the rock. 
[In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES, 
and the people are beat in]

Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol. 
Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes. 
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend

He heard the name of death. [A noise within]

That would depopulate the city and

The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,

MENENIUS. If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people, 
The which shall turn you to no further harm 
MENENIUS. Now the good gods forbid 
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost- 
A brand to th' end o' th' world. 
SICINIUS. The service of the foot, 
Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence, 
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late, 
MENENIUS. Consider this: he has been bred i' th' wars 
It is the humane way; the other course 
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it 
Unknown to the beginning. 
Be you then as the people's officer. 
SICINIUS. Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there; 
[To the SENATORS] Let me desire your company; he must come,

Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,

Before he should thus stoop to th' herd, but that 
The violent fit o' th' time craves it as physic 
For the whole state, I would put mine armour on, 
MENENIUS. Return to th' tribunes. 
CORIOLANUS. For them! I cannot do it to the gods; 
I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me 
In peace what each of them by th' other lose 
The same you are not, which for your best ends 
To th' people, not by your own instruction, 
Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you, 
The hazard of much blood.

For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard 
Not what is dangerous present, but the los 
Thy knee bussing the stones- for in such busines 
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant 
More learned than the ears- waving thy head, 
Now humble as the ripest mulberry 
That will not hold the handling. Or say to them 
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess, 
COMINIUS. I have been i' th' market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit 
And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place! 
I shall discharge to th' life. 
Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice 
That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves 
The glasses of my sight! A beggar's tongue 
Mother, I am going to the market-place; 
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going. 
I' th' way of flattery further. 
COMINIUS. Away! The tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself 
CORIOLANUS. The word is 'mildly.' Pray you let us go. 
Rome. The Forum 
Enforce him with his envy to the people, 
And that the spoil got on the Antiates 
Of all the voices that we have procur'd, 
Set down by th' poll? 
SICINIUS. Assemble presently the people hither; 
I' th' right and strength o' th' commons' be it either 
Insisting on the old prerogative 
And power i' th' truth o' th' cause. 
Enforce the present execution 
CORIOLANUS. Ay, as an ostler, that for th' poorest piece 
Will bear the knave by th' volume. Th' honour'd gods 
Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice 
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,

If you submit you to the people's voices, 
The warlike service he has done, consider; think 
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show 
Like graves i' th' holy churchyard. 
CORIOLANUS. What is the matter, 
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour 
For which you are a traitor to the people. 
CORIOLANUS. The fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people! 
As I do pray the gods. 
PLEBEIANS. To th' rock, to th' rock, with him! 
Deserves th' extremest death. 
MENENIUS. Is this the promise that you made your mother? 
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death, 
Their mercy at the price of one fair word, 
Envied against the people, seeking means 
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence 
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers 
That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people, 
And in the power of us the tribunes, we, 
From off the rock Tarpeian, never more 
To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name, 
As enemy to the people and his country. 
As reek o' th' rotten fens, whose loves I prize 
As the dead carcasses of unburied men 
Fan you into despair! Have the power still 
For you the city, thus I turn my back;

Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS 
Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN 
BELARIUS. [To IMOGEN] You are not well. Remain here in the cave; 
Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom 
How much the quantity, the weight as much 
Love's reason's without reason. The bier at door, 
'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn. 
Th' imperious seas breed monsters; for the dish, 
BELARIUS. To th' field, to th' field! 
BELARIUS. And shalt be ever. Exit IMOGEN into the cave 
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh 
The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly 
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine 
His perishing root with the increasing vine! 
Cloten, the son o' th' Queen. I fear some ambush. 
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool; 
I am son to th' Queen. 
GUIDERIUS. Those that I reverence, those I fear- the wise: 
CLOTEN. Die the death. 
And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads. 
ARVIRAGUS. None in the world; you did mistake him, sure. 
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice, 
Is oft the cease of fear. 
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne 
Son to the Queen, after his own report; 
Displace our heads where- thank the gods!- they grow, 
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law 
For we do fear the law? What company 
May make some stronger head- the which he hearing, 
More perilous than the head. 
Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe'er, 
To hunt this day; the boy Fidele's sickness 
His head from him. I'll throw't into the creek 
Behind our rock, and let it to the sea 
And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten. 
So the revenge alone pursu'd me! Polydore, 
You and Fidele play the cooks; I'll stay 
As zephyrs blowing below the violet, 
Their royal blood enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind 
That by the top doth take the mountain pine 
And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis wonder 
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream, 
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter? 
And brings the dire occasion in his arms 
ARVIRAGUS. The bird is dead 
My brother wears thee not the one half so well 
The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare 
ARVIRAGUS. O' th' floor; 
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor 
The azur'd hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor 
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander, 
Out-sweet'ned not thy breath. The ruddock would, 
Is now due debt. To th' grave. 
Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th' ground, 
BELARIUS. Great griefs, I see, med'cine the less, for Cloten 
That angel of the world- doth make distinction 
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin. 
GUIDERIUS. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th' East; 
GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the heat o' th' sun 
Nor the furious winter's rages; 
ARVIRAGUS. Fear no more the frown o' th' great; 
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke. 
To thee the reed is as the oak. 
The sceptre, learning, physic, must 
GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the lightning flash, 
ARVIRAGUS. Nor th' all-dreaded thunder-stone; 
Re-enter BELARIUS with the body of CLOTEN 
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' night 
The ground that gave them first has them again. 
IMOGEN. [Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way? 
[Seeing the body] 
These flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world; 
This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream; 
Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes 
The dream's here still. Even when I wake it is 
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus? 
I know the shape of's leg; this is his hand, 
The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face- 
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, 
From this most bravest vessel of the world 
Struck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas, 
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart, 
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious 
Murd'rous to th' senses? That confirms it home. 
That we the horrider may seem to those

After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending 
CAPTAIN. The Senate hath stirr'd up the confiners 
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo, 
CAPTAIN. With the next benefit o' th' wind. 
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir, 
SOOTHSAYER. Last night the very gods show'd me a vision- 
I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd 
From the spongy south to this part of the west, 
There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which portends, 
Success to th' Roman host. 
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime 
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead. 
Let's see the boy's face. 
No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope 
LUCIUS. Thou dost approve thyself the very same; 
No less belov'd. The Roman Emperor's letters, 
IMOGEN. I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods, 
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep 
The boy hath taught us manly duties; let us 
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can, 
Some falls are means the happier to arise. Exeunt 
A fever with the absence of her son; 
The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen 
The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow, 
The day that she was missing he was here. 
CYMBELINE. The time is troublesome. 
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn, 
Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent. 
CYMBELINE. Now for the counsel of my son and queen! 
The want is but to put those pow'rs in motion 
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not 
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work. 
Even to the note o' th' King, or I'll fall in them. 
Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS 
GUIDERIUS. The noise is round about us. 
Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans 
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us. 
To the King's party there's no going. Newness 
Among the bands-may drive us to a render 
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh, 
Of many in the army. Many years, 
From my remembrance. And, besides, the King 
Who find in my exile the want of breeding, 
The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless 
To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd, 
The shrinking slaves of winter. 
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th' army. 
To look upon the holy sun, to have 
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining 
I'll take the better care; but if you will not, 
The hazard therefore due fall on me by 
The hands of Romans! 
Lead, lead. [Aside] The time seems long; their blood thinks scorn

Elsinore. A platform before the Castle. 
Ber. Long live the King! 
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. 
Mar. And liegemen to the Dane. 
With us to watch the minutes of this night, 
When yond same star that's westward from the pole 
The bell then beating one- 
Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead. 
Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio. 
In which the majesty of buried Denmark 
Without the sensible and true avouch 
Mar. Is it not like the King? 
Such was the very armour he had on 
When he th' ambitious Norway combated. 
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion, 
So nightly toils the subject of the land, 
Does not divide the Sunday from the week. 
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? 
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, 
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet 
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; 
Against the which a moiety competent 
To the inheritance of Fortinbras, 
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart 
And carriage of the article design'd, 
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, 
Is the main motive of our preparations, 
The source of this our watch, and the chief head 
Of this post-haste and romage in the land. 
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King 
That was and is the question of these wars. 
Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. 
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, 
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead 
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; 
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star 
And even the like precurse of fierce events, 
As harbingers preceding still the fates 
And prologue to the omen coming on, 
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth 
The cock crows. 
To offer it the show of violence; 
For it is as the air, invulnerable, 
Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. 
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, 
Awake the god of day; and at his warning, 
Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies 
To his confine; and of the truth herein 
Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock. 
The bird of dawning singeth all night long; 
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, 
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. 
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, 
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill. 
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle. 
Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, 
The memory be green, and that it us befitted 
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, 
Importing the surrender of those lands 
Thus much the business is: we have here writ 
His further gait herein, in that the levies, 
The lists, and full proportions are all made 
To business with the King, more than the scope 
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? 
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane 
The head is not more native to the heart, 
The hand more instrumental to the mouth, 
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. 
King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you? 
Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun. 
Seek for thy noble father in the dust. 
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, 
Nor the dejected havior of the visage, 
These but the trappings and the suits of woe. 
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound 
As any the most vulgar thing to sense, 
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, 
From the first corse till he that died to-day, 
As of a father; for let the world take note 
You are the most immediate to our throne, 
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, 
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, 
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, 
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd 
Seem to me all the uses of this world! 
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven 
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears 
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, 
Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. 
Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats 
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. 
Hor. My lord, the King your father. 
Ham. The King my father? 
Upon the witness of these gentlemen, 
In the dead vast and middle of the night 
Almost to jelly with the act of fear, 
And I with them the third night kept the watch; 
Form of the thing, each word made true and good, 
The apparition comes. I knew your father. 
Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd. 
But even then the morning cock crew loud, 
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away 
Hold you the watch to-night? 
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, 
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come! 
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. 
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius. 
And, sister, as the winds give benefit 
Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, 
A violet in the youth of primy nature, 
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; 
The inward service of the mind and soul 
The virtue of his will; but you must fear, 
The safety and health of this whole state, 
Unto the voice and yielding of that body 
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, 
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. 
And keep you in the rear of your affection, 
Out of the shot and danger of desire. 
The chariest maid is prodigal enough 
If she unmask her beauty to the moon. 
The canker galls the infants of the spring 
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth 
Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep 
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, 
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads 
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, 
Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. 
For the apparel oft proclaims the man, 
And they in France of the best rank and station 
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. 
And it must follow, as the night the day, 
Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend. 
And you yourself shall keep the key of it. 
Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. 
What is between you? Give me up the truth. 
Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, 
With almost all the holy vows of heaven. 
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul 
Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, 
The better to beguile. This is for all: 
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. 
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle. 
Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. 
Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season 
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. 
Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, 
Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels, 
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out 
The triumph of his pledge. 
And to the manner born, it is a custom 
More honour'd in the breach than the observance. 
The pith and marrow of our attribute. 
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, 
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, 
The form of plausive manners, that these men 
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, 
Shall in the general censure take corruption 
From that particular fault. The dram of e'il 
Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal. 
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre 
Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, 
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? 
Ham. Why, what should be the fear? 
Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, 
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff 
That beetles o'er his base into the sea, 
The very place puts toys of desperation, 
That looks so many fadoms to the sea 
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. 
Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. 
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications. 
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, 
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, 
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature 
To tell the secrets of my prison house, 
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. 
Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is; 
As meditation or the thoughts of love, 
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed 
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark 
The serpent that did sting thy father's life 
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power 
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. 
That it went hand in hand even with the vow 
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. 
My custom always of the afternoon, 
And in the porches of my ears did pour 
The leperous distilment; whose effect 
The natural gates and alleys of the body, 
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; 
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, 
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be 
The glowworm shows the matin to be near 
Yea, from the table of my memory 
Within the book and volume of my brain, 
Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave 
Ham. Why, right! You are in the right! 
Ghost cries under the stage. 
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage. 
Hor. Propose the oath, my lord.

The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay, 
The insolence of office, and the spurns 
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,

The tongue offends not that reports his death; 
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, 
Not he which says the dead is not alive. 
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news 
The never-daunted Percy to the earth, 
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp- 
From the best-temper'd courage in his troops; 
Which once in him abated, an the rest 
And as the thing that's heavy in itself

The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword 
Had three times slain th' appearance of the King, 
Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame 
Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all 
Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out 
Under the conduct of young Lancaster 
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full. 
And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints, 
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head 
The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring 
To frown upon th' enrag'd Northumberland! 
Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die! 
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain 
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end 
And darkness be the burier of the dead! 
The lives of all your loving complices 
Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er 
You cast th' event of war, my noble lord, 
And summ'd the account of chance before you said 
That in the dole of blows your son might drop. 
The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall'n, 
And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd 
Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd; 
I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:

My lord your son had only but the corpse, 
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight; 
The action of their bodies from their souls; 
As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop

The aptest way for safety and revenge.

Turning the word to sword, and life to death. 
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour, 
Would he abuse the countenance of the king, 
How deep you were within the books of God? 
To us the speaker in His parliament, 
To us th' imagin'd voice of God himself, 
The very opener and intelligencer 
Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven, 
But you misuse the reverence of your place, 
Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n 
Under the counterfeited zeal of God, 
The subjects of His substitute, my father, 
And both against the peace of heaven and him

The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court,

As we will ours; and here, between the armies,

For I am on the sudden something ill. 
But heaviness foreruns the good event. 
MOWBRAY. So much the worse, if your own rule be true. 
PRINCE JOHN. The word of peace is rend'red. Hark, how they shout!

FALSTAFF. I would you had but the wit; 'twere better than your

the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it; makes it 
delectable shapes; which delivered o'er to the voice, the tongue, 
which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of 
your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood; which before, 
cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the 
badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it, 
and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes. It 
illumineth the face, which, as a beacon, gives warning to all the 
rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital 
captain, the heart, who, great and puff'd up with this retinue, 
that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets 
it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did

Come underneath the yoke of government. 
Where is the Prince your brother? 
How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother? 
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace 
As flaws congealed in the spring of day.

As, force perforce, the age will pour it in- 
KING. Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds; 
And he, the noble image of my youth, 
Stretches itself beyond the hour of death. 
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape, 
The Prince but studies his companions 
Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language, 
'Tis needful that the most immodest word

By which his Grace must mete the lives of other,

PRINCE. Who saw the Duke of Clarence? 
How doth the King? 
PRINCE. Heard he the good news yet? Tell it him. 
PRINCE HUMPHREY. He alt'red much upon the hearing it. 
The King your father is dispos'd to sleep. 
CLARENCE. Let us withdraw into the other room. 
PRINCE. No; I will sit and watch here by the King. 
Exeunt all but the PRINCE

Derives itself to me. [Putting on the crown] Lo where it sits- 
Which God shall guard; and put the world's whole strength 
CLARENCE. Doth the King call? 
CLARENCE. We left the Prince my brother here, my liege, 
KING. The Prince of Wales! Where is he? Let me see him. 
PRINCE HUMPHREY. He came not through the chamber where we stay'd. 
KING. Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow? 
KING. The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go, seek him out. 
For this the foolish over-careful fathers 
The cank'red heaps of strange-achieved gold; 
When, like the bee, tolling from every flower 
The virtuous sweets, 
We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees, 
Yields his engrossments to the ending father. 
WARWICK. My lord, I found the Prince in the next room, 
KING. But wherefore did he take away the crown? 
Depart the chamber, leave us here alone. 
Exeunt all but the KING and the PRINCE 
Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee. 
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear 
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse 
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms. 
Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity: 
And to the English court assemble now, 
Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit 
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways? 
For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks 
The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog 
The moist impediments unto my speech, 
The course of it so far. There is your crown, 
And he that wears the crown immortally 
And never live to show th' incredulous world 
The noble change that I have purposed! 
And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending 
Hath fed upon the body of my father; 
The quarrel of a true inheritor. 
Did with the least affection of a welcome 
Give entertainment to the might of it, 
And make me as the poorest vassal is, 
That thou mightst win the more thy father's love, 
And hear, I think, the very latest counsel 
For all the soil of the achievement goes 
With me into the earth. It seem'd in me 
Changes the mood; for what in me was purchas'd 
So thou the garland wear'st successively. 
To lead out many to the Holy Land, 
May waste the memory of the former days.

For all the temporal lands which men devout

As much as would maintain, to the King's honour,

We charge you, in the name of God, take heed; 
'Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords 
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze 
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond 
The founder of this law and female bar. 
That the land Salique is in Germany, 
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe; 
Where Charles the Great, having subdu'd the Saxons, 
Who, holding in disdain the German women 
Then doth it well appear the Salique law 
Was not devised for the realm of France; 
Nor did the French possess the Salique land 
Idly suppos'd the founder of this law; 
Who died within the year of our redemption 
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great 
Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French 
Beyond the river Sala, in the year 
Make claim and title to the crown of France. 
Hugh Capet also, who usurp'd the crown 
Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male 
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, 
Convey'd himself as th' heir to th' Lady Lingare,

To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son 
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth, 
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,

Against the Scot, who will make road upon us

Galling the gleaned land with hot assays, 
Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood.

The act of order to a peopled kingdom. 
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds, 
To the tent-royal of their emperor; 
The singing masons building roofs of gold, 
The civil citizens kneading up the honey, 
The poor mechanic porters crowding in 
The sad-ey'd justice, with his surly hum, 
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer, 
As many lines close in the dial's centre; 
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, 
The name of hardiness and policy. 
KING HENRY. Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin. 
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,

Tell us the Dauphin's mind.

Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third. 
In answer of which claim, the Prince our master 
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim 
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks. 
KING HENRY. We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us; 
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard. 
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd 
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state, 
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France, 
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us. 
And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his 
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance 
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn. 
But this lies all within the will of God, 
Tell you the Dauphin, I am coming on, 
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin

CHORUS. Now all the youth of England are on fire, 
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies; 
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought

Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britaine, 
As waters to the sucking of a gulf. 
Left by the fatal and neglected English 
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe; 
To view the sick and feeble parts of France;

So the proportions of defence are fill'd; 
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;

KING. Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; 
Or close the wall up with our English dead. 
But when the blast of war blows in our ears, 
Then imitate the action of the tiger: 
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, 
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect; 
Let it pry through the portage of the head 
Like the brass cannon: let the brow o'erwhelm it 
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean. 
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide; 
Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit 
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear 
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, 
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot: 
BARDOLPH. On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach! 
NYM. Pray thee, Corporal, stay; the knocks are too hot, and for 
mine own part I have not a case of lives. The humour of it is too 
hot; that is the very plain-song of it. 
PISTOL. The plain-song is most just; for humours do abound:

red-fac'd; by the means whereof 'a faces it out, but fights not. 
For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the

FLUELLEN. To the mines! Tell you the Duke it is not so good to come 
to the mines; for, look you, the mines is not according to the 
disciplines of the war; the concavities of it is not sufficient. 
For, look you, th' athversary- you may discuss unto the Duke, 
look you- is digt himself four yard under the countermines; by 
GOWER. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is 
FLUELLEN. By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will verify 
as much in his beard; he has no more directions in the true 
disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than 
GOWER. Here 'a comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with 
certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient 
he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the 
world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans. 
GOWER. How now, Captain Macmorris! Have you quit the mines? Have 
the pioneers given o'er? 
MACMORRIS. By Chrish, la, tish ill done! The work ish give over, 
the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I swear, and my 
father's soul, the work ish ill done; it ish give over; I would 
have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, 
concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in the way

my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline, 
that is the point. 
MACMORRIS. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me. The day

This is the latest parle we will admit; 
If I begin the batt'ry once again, 
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur 
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up, 
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart, 
Array'd in flames, like to the prince of fiends, 
If your pure maidens fall into the hand 
When down the hill he holds his fierce career? 
Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil, 
As send precepts to the Leviathan 
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace 
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds 
The blind and bloody with foul hand 
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters; 
Your fathers taken by the silver beards, 
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls; 
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd 
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry 
The Dauphin, whom of succours we entreated, 
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French; 
The winter coming on, and sickness growing

keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There 
is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge- I think in my

FLUELLEN. Here is the man. 
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well. 
That stands upon the rolling restless stone- 
signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning,

But Exeter hath given the doom of death 
Therefore, go speak- the Duke will hear thy voice;

Enter the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE, the LORD RAMBURES, the DUKE OF ORLEANS, 
the DAUPHIN, with others 
CONSTABLE. Tut! I have the best armour of the world. 
CONSTABLE. It is the best horse of Europe. 
ORLEANS. You are as well provided of both as any prince in the 
any that treads but on four pasterns. Ca, ha! he bounds from the 
earth as if his entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the 
am a hawk. He trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it; 
the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of 
ORLEANS. He's of the colour of the nutmeg. 
DAUPHIN. And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus: 
he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water 
DAUPHIN. It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the 
DAUPHIN. Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of 
the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my 
palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea: turn the sands into 
sovereign to ride on; and for the world- familiar to us and 
DAUPHIN. Me well; which is the prescript praise and perfection of a 
proverb so little kin to the purpose. 
RAMBURES. My Lord Constable, the armour that I saw in your tent

ears of the English. 
ORLEANS. The Dauphin longs for morning. 
RAMBURES. He longs to eat the English. 
ORLEANS. By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince. 
CONSTABLE. Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath. 
ORLEANS. He is simply the most active gentleman of France. 
ORLEANS. And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.' 
CONSTABLE. Well plac'd! There stands your friend for the devil;

When creeping murmur and the poring dark 
Fills the wide vessel of the universe. 
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night, 
The hum of either army stilly sounds, 
That the fix'd sentinels almost receive 
The secret whispers of each other's watch. 
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face; 
Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents 
The armourers accomplishing the knights, 
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do ton, 
And the third hour of drowsy morning name. 
The confident and over-lusty French 
Do the low-rated English play at dice; 
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night 
So tediously away. The poor condemned English, 
The morning's danger; and their gesture sad 
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon 
The royal captain of this ruin'd band 
Unto the weary and all-watched night; 
A largess universal, like the sun, 
A little touch of Harry in the night.

Thus may we gather honey from the weed,

I love the lovely bully. What is thy name? 
PISTOL. The figo for thee, then! 
FLUELLEN. So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer. It is the 
greatest admiration in the universal world, when the true and 
aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept: if you 
would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, 
pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you, you shall find the 
ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it,

methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King's

obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.

merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of 
many irreconcil'd iniquities, you may call the business of the 
master the author of the servant's damnation. But this is not so: 
the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his 
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; 
spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out 
with all unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them the 
virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars 
their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace 
with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law

Ill-favouredly become the morning field;

Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,

The First Part of King Henry the Sixth 
Dead March. Enter the funeral of KING HENRY THE FIFTH, 
attended on by the DUKE OF BEDFORD, Regent of France, 
the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, Protector, the DUKE OF EXETER, 
the EARL OF WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER 
BEDFORD. Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to 
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky 
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars 
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long! 
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap 
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French 
WINCHESTER. He was a king bless'd of the King of kings; 
Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day 
The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought; 
The Church's prayers made him so prosperous. 
GLOUCESTER. The Church! Where is it? Had not churchmen 
And lookest to command the Prince and realm. 
GLOUCESTER. Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh; 
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st, 
Let's to the altar. Heralds, wait on us. 
And none but women left to wail the dead. 
HENRY the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate: 
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens. 
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns 
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost. 
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered 
Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms; 
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes, 
France is revolted from the English quite, 
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims; 
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd; 
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side. 
EXETER. The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him! 
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French. 
The circumstance I'll tell you more at large. 
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord, 
Retiring from the siege of Orleans, 
By three and twenty thousand of the French 
They pitched in the ground confusedly 
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in. 
More than three hours the fight continued; 
The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms; 
All the whole army stood agaz'd on him. 
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle. 
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up 
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward. 
He, being in the vaward plac'd behind 
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre. 
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace, 
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back; 
Durst not presume to look once in the face. 
Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise. 
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne; 
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend; 
The English army is grown weak and faint; 
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply 
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly, 
GLOUCESTER. I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can 
To view th' artillery and munition; 
EXETER. To Eltham will I, where the young King is, 
The King from Eltham I intend to steal, 
Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES THE DAUPHIN, ALENCON, 
CHARLES. Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens 
So in the earth, to this day is not known. 
Late did he shine upon the English side; 
Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts, 
REIGNIER. Let's raise the siege. Why live we idly here? 
Now for the honour of the forlorn French! 
Here alarum. They are beaten hack by the English, with 
CHARLES. Who ever saw the like? What men have I! 
The other lords, like lions wanting food, 
During the time Edward the Third did reign. 
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege. 
Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS 
BASTARD. Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him. 
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence? 
And drive the English forth the bounds of France. 
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath, 
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome: 
Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS with 
Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind; 
The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine's churchyard, 
And fightest with the sword of Deborah. 
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus. 
Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard. 
PUCELLE. Assign'd am I to be the English scourge. 
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise. 
Glory is like a circle in the water, 
With Henry's death the English circle ends; 
Dispersed are the glories it included. 
Helen, the mother of great Constantine, 
Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth, 
ALENCON. Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege. 
London. Before the Tower gates 
Enter the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, with his serving-men 
GLOUCESTER. I am come to survey the Tower this day; 
Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls. 
FIRST SERVING-MAN. It is the noble Duke of Gloucester. 
FIRST SERVING-MAN. Villains, answer you so the Lord 
FIRST WARDER. [Within] The Lord protect him! so we 
There's none Protector of the realm but I. 
Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize. 
[GLOUCESTER'S men rush at the Tower gates, and 
WOODVILLE the Lieutenant speaks within] 
Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter. 
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids. 
Thou art no friend to God or to the King. 
Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly. 
SERVING-MEN. Open the gates unto the Lord Protector, 
Enter to the PROTECTOR at the Tower gates WINCHESTER 
And not Protector of the King or realm. 
Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down. 
WINCHESTER. Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the 
Here GLOUCESTER'S men beat out the CARDINAL'S 
men; and enter in the hurly burly the MAYOR OF 
Thus contumeliously should break the peace! 
Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use. 
Because he is Protector of the realm, 
And would have armour here out of the Tower, 
To crown himself King and suppress the Prince. 
this day against God's peace and the King's, we charge 
GLOUCESTER. Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law; 
This Cardinal's more haughty than the devil. 
MAYOR. See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart. 
Enter, on the walls, the MASTER-GUNNER 
And how the English have the suburbs won. 
The Prince's espials have informed me 
How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd, 
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city, 
And thence discover how with most advantage 
And thou shalt find me at the Governor's. Exit 
Enter SALISBURY and TALBOT on the turrets, with 
TALBOT. The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner 
Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles; 
But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart 
Here, said they, is the terror of the French, 
The scarecrow that affrights our children so. 
Then broke I from the officers that led me, 
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground 
To hurl at the beholders of my shame; 
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart. 
Enter the BOY with a linstock 
And view the Frenchmen how they fortify. 
Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee. 
GARGRAVE. I think at the North Gate; for there stand lords. 
GLANSDALE. And I here, at the bulwark of the bridge. 
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars; 
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field. 
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world. 
Remember to avenge me on the French.' 
Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn. 
What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens? 
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise? 
MESSENGER. My lord, my lord, the French have gather'd 
The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd, 
Is come with a great power to raise the siege. 
Here an alarum again, and TALBOT pursueth the 
[A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers] 
Hark, countrymen! Either renew the fight 
Or tear the lions out of England's coat; 
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf, 
Or horse or oxen from the leopard, 
The shame hereof will make me hide my head. 
Flourish. Enter on the walls, LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, 
PUCELLE. Advance our waving colours on the walls; 
Rescu'd is Orleans from the English. 
That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next. 
Recover'd is the town of Orleans. 
REIGNIER. Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the 
Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires 
And feast and banquet in the open streets 
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us. 
When they shall hear how we have play'd the men. 
CHARLES. 'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won; 
And all the priests and friars in my realm 
Than the rich jewel'd coffer of Darius, 
Before the kings and queens of France. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Near to the walls, by some apparent sign 
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard. 
By whose approach the regions of Artois, 
This happy night the Frenchmen are secure, 
To join with witches and the help of hell! 
If underneath the standard of the French 
That if it chance the one of us do fail 
The other yet may rise against their force. 
Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right 
[The English scale the walls and cry 'Saint George! 
SENTINEL. Arm! arm! The enemy doth make assault. 
The French leap o'er the walls in their shirts. 
REIGNIER. If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him 
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me? 
That, being captain of the watch to-night, 
As that whereof I had the government, 
About relieving of the sentinels. 
PUCELLE. Question, my lords, no further of the case, 
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made. 
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword; 
ORLEANS. Within the town 
BEDFORD. The day begins to break, and night is fled 
Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth. 
TALBOT. Bring forth the body of old Salisbury 
And here advance it in the market-place, 
The middle centre of this cursed town. 
Upon the which, that every one may read, 
Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans, 
The treacherous manner of his mournful death, 
I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace, 
BEDFORD. 'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began, 
Rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds, 
They did amongst the troops of armed men 
Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field. 
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night, 
Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull, 
We'll follow them with all the power we have. 
Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts 
So much applauded through the realm of France? 
TALBOT. Here is the Talbot; who would speak with him? 
MESSENGER. The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne, 
That she may boast she hath beheld the man 
Whose glory fills the world with loud report. 
AUVERGNE. The Castle 
Enter the COUNTESS and her PORTER 
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me. 
COUNTESS. The plot is laid; if all things fall out right, 
Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight, 
COUNTESS. And he is welcome. What! is this the man? 
COUNTESS. Is this the scourge of France? 
That with his name the mothers still their babes? 
To know the cause of your abrupt departure. 
But now the substance shall endure the like 
COUNTESS. Why, art not thou the man? 
For what you see is but the smallest part 
I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here, 
COUNTESS. This is a riddling merchant for the nonce; 
The mind of Talbot as you did mistake 
The outward composition of his body. 
London. The Temple garden 
Enter the EARLS OF SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK; 
SUFFOLK. Within the Temple Hall we were too loud; 
The garden here is more convenient. 
PLANTAGENET. Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth; 
Or else was wrangling Somerset in th' error? 
SUFFOLK. Faith, I have been a truant in the law 
And therefore frame the law unto my will. 
WARWICK. Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch; 
Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth; 
Between two blades, which bears the better temper; 
Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye 
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law, 
The truth appears so naked on my side 
And stands upon the honour of his birth, 
But dare maintain the party of the truth, 
And say withal I think he held the right. 
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree 
Shall yield the other in the right opinion. 
VERNON. Then, for the truth and plainness of the case, 
Giving my verdict on the white rose side. 
Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red, 
And keep me on the side where still I am. 
The argument you held was wrong in you; 
The truth on our side. 
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him. 
Third son to the third Edward, King of England. 
PLANTAGENET. He bears him on the place's privilege, 
Or flourish to the height of my degree. 
Shall be wip'd out in the next Parliament, 
Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester; 
Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden, 
Shall send between the Red Rose and the White 
VERNON. In your behalf still will I wear the same. 
The Tower of London 
Even like a man new haled from the rack, 
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death, 
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. 
That droops his sapless branches to the ground. 
We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber; 
But now the arbitrator of despairs, 
Else with the like I had requited him. 
And for alliance sake, declare the cause 
Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king, 
The first-begotten and the lawful heir 
Of Edward king, the third of that descent; 
During whose reign the Percies of the north, 
Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne. 
The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this 
I was the next by birth and parentage; 
To King Edward the Third; whereas he 
They laboured to plant the rightful heir, 
Long after this, when Henry the Fifth, 
And have install'd me in the diadem; 
But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl, 
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers, 
In whom the title rested, were suppress'd. 
PLANTAGENET. Of Which, my lord, your honour is the last. 
Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather; 
Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster 
Might but redeem the passage of your age! 
Exeunt GAOLERS, hearing out the body of MORTIMER 
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer, 
Chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort; 
And therefore haste I to the Parliament, 
Or make my ill th' advantage of my good. Exit

Or I would see his heart out ere the priest

And will not you maintain the thing you teach, 
But prove a chief offender in the same?

ALL. Welcome, high Prince, the mighty Duke of York! 
To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France: 
The presence of a king engenders love 
KING HENRY. When Gloucester says the word, King Henry 
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers 
Which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth 
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe: 
PUCELLE. These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen, 
Talk like the vulgar sort of market-men 
And that we find the slothful watch but weak, 
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.

WATCH. Enter, go in; the market-bell is rung. 
PUCELLE. Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the 
[LA PUCELLE, &c., enter the town] 
Here is the best and safest passage in? 
Enter LA PUCELLE, on the top, thrusting out 
PUCELLE. Behold, this is the happy wedding torch 
But burning fatal to the Talbotites. Exit 
BASTARD. See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend; 
The burning torch in yonder turret stands. 
A prophet to the fall of all our foes! 
Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently, 
And then do execution on the watch. Alarum. Exeunt 
That hardly we escap'd the pride of France. Exit 
and REIGNIER, on the walls 
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast 
'Twas full of darnel-do you like the taste? 
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn. 
[The English party whisper together in council] 
God speed the parliament! Who shall be the Speaker? 
TALBOT. Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field? 
But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest. 
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls, 
PUCELLE. Away, captains! Let's get us from the walls; 
That we are here. Exeunt from the walls 
Either to get the town again or die; 
So sure I swear to get the town or die. 
The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord, 
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen, 
Came to the field, and vanquished his foes. 
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts, 
Exeunt against the town all but BEDFORD and attendants 
We are like to have the overthrow again. 
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life. Exit 
Exit into the town 
What is the trust or strength of foolish man? 
An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest 
Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks? 
Now will we take some order in the town, 
And then depart to Paris to the King, 
The noble Duke of Bedford, late deceas'd, 
For that's the end of human misery. Exeunt 
The plains near Rouen 
Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD, ALENCON, LA PUCELLE, 
If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul'd. 
And we will make thee famous through the world. 
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy 
To leave the Talbot and to follow us. 
To bring this matter to the wished end. 
Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive 
There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,

Now in the rearward comes the Duke and his. 
CHARLES. A parley with the Duke of Burgundy! 
BURGUNDY. Who craves a parley with the Burgundy? 
PUCELLE. The princely Charles of France, thy countryman. 
And see the cities and the towns defac'd 
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe; 
As looks the mother on her lowly babe 
See, see the pining malady of France; 
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds, 
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe? 
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms. 
And seek how we may prejudice the foe. Exeunt

GLOUCESTER. Lord Bishop, set the crown upon his head. 
WINCHESTER. God save King Henry, of that name the Sixth! 
Writ to your Grace from th' Duke of Burgundy. 
TALBOT. Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee! 
To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg, [Plucking it off] 
Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest: 
This dastard, at the battle of Patay, 
And that the French were almost ten to one, 
GLOUCESTER. To say the truth, this fact was infamous 
Knights of the Garter were of noble birth, 
Such as were grown to credit by the wars; 
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight, 
And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter 
GLOUCESTER. [Viewing the superscription] What means his 
No more but plain and bluntly 'To the King!' 
Together with the pitiful complaints 
And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.' 
KING HENRY. Is that the worst this letter doth contain? 
GLOUCESTER. It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes. 
VERNON. Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign. 
BASSET. And me, my lord, grant me the combat too. 
BASSET. Crossing the sea from England into France, 
Upbraided me about the rose I wear, 
Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves 
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth 
About a certain question in the law 
Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him; 
I crave the benefit of law of arms. 
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower 
Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart. 
SOMERSET. The quarrel toucheth none but us alone; 
To trouble and disturb the King and us? 
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause. 
Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France! 
O, think upon the conquest of my father, 
Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd. 
Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest, 
From thence to England, where I hope ere long 
WARWICK. My Lord of York, I promise you, the King 
Prettily, methought, did play the orator. 
In that he wears the badge of Somerset. 
For had the passions of thy heart burst out, 
This shouldering of each other in the court, 
There comes the ruin, there begins confusion. Exit 
TALBOT. Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter; 
Summon their general unto the wall. 
Trumpet sounds a parley. Enter, aloft, the 
GENERAL OF THE FRENCH, and others 
You tempt the fury of my three attendants, 
Who in a moment even with the earth 
If you forsake the offer of their love. 
GENERAL OF THE FRENCH. Thou ominous and fearful owl of 
The period of thy tyranny approacheth. 
If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed, 
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee. 
To wall thee from the liberty of flight, 
And pale destruction meets thee in the face. 
Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament 
This is the latest glory of thy praise 
For ere the glass that now begins to run 
Finish the process of his sandy hour, 
Hark! hark! The Dauphin's drum, a warning bell, 
TALBOT. He fables not; I hear the enemy. 
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel 
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay. 
YORK. Are not the speedy scouts return'd again 
That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin? 
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led, 
And cannot help the noble chevalier. 
Never so needful on the earth of France, 
Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot, 
LUCY. O, send some succour to the distress'd lord! 
That sund'red friends greet in the hour of death. 
But curse the cause I cannot aid the man. 
LUCY. Thus, while the vulture of sedition 
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders, 
The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror, 
Henry the Fifth. Whiles they each other cross, 
Might with a sally of the very town 
Be buckled with. The over daring Talbot 
That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name. 
And whiles the honourable captain there 
You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour, 
The levied succours that should lend him aid, 
Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy, 
SOMERSET. York lies; he might have sent and had the horse. 
LUCY. The fraud of England, not the force of France, 
Hath now entrapp'd the noble minded Talbot. 
SOMERSET. Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight; 
LUCY. His fame lives in the world, his shame in you. Exeunt 
The English camp near Bordeaux 
The world will say he is not Talbot's blood 
Upon my death the French can little boast; 
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won; 
If the first hour I shrink and run away. 
JOHN. To fight I will, but not to fly the foe. 
Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I; 
The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word 
And left us to the rage of France his sword. 
The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done 
TALBOT. When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck 
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee. 
The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood 
From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood 
Here purposing the Bastard to destroy, 
Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly, 
Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry? 
The help of one stands me in little stead. 
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day. 
JOHN. The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart; 
The coward horse that bears me fall and die! 
And like me to the peasant boys of France, 
Surely, by all the glory you have won, 
Another part of the field 
Into the clust'ring battle of the French; 
Enter soldiers, bearing the body of JOHN TALBOT 
Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky, 
BASTARD. How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging wood, 
To be the pillage of a giglot wench.' 
So, rushing in the bowels of the French, 
See where he lies inhearsed in the arms 
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms! 
During the life, let us not wrong it dead. 
LUCY. Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent, 
To know who hath obtain'd the glory of the day. 
And to survey the bodies of the dead. 
LUCY. But where's the great Alcides of the field, 
The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge, 
Knight of the noble order of Saint George, 
Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fleece, 
Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth 
Of all his wars within the realm of France? 
The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath, 
It were enough to fright the realm of France. 
It would amaze the proudest of you all. 
They would but stink, and putrefy the air.

Out of the powerful regions under earth,

Before that England give the French the foil. 
See! they forsake me. Now the time is come 
Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust. Exit

A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!

YORK. O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man: 
YORK. Curse, miscreant, when thou comest to the stake. 
The King of Naples-whosoe'er thou art. 
So doth the swan her downy cygnets save, 
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams, 
Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough. 
MARGARET. He talks at random; sure, the man is mad. 
For though her father be the King of Naples, 
And our nobility will scorn the match.

And have no portion in the choice myself.

She was the first fruit of my bach'lorship.

WARWICK. The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought: 
YORK. She and the Dauphin have been juggling. 
'Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd, 
Upon the country where you make abode; 
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death 
With letters of commission from the King. 
For know, my lords, the states of Christendom, 
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French; 
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train 
After the slaughter of so many peers, 
Have we not lost most part of all the towns, 
The utter loss of all the realm of France. 
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.

In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil, 
The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne, and Alencon, 
Deliver up my title in the Queen 
To your most gracious hands, that are the substance 
The happiest gift that ever marquis gave, 
The fairest queen that ever king receiv'd. 
The mutual conference that my mind hath had, 
Makes me the bolder to salute my king 
Such is the fulness of my heart's content. 
Here are the articles of contracted peace 
Between our sovereign and the French King Charles, 
GLOUCESTER. [Reads] 'Imprimis: It is agreed between the French King 
for Henry King of England, that the said Henry shall espouse the

Your grief, the common grief of all the land. 
His valour, coin, and people, in the wars? 
With all the learned Council of the realm, 
Studied so long, sat in the Council House 
Razing the characters of your renown, 
Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast, 
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine 
Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style 
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse. 
SALISBURY. Now, by the death of Him that died for all, 
These counties were the keys of Normandy! 
And are the cities that I got with wounds 
That dims the honour of this warlike isle! 
It was the pleasure of my lord the King. 
And no great friend, I fear me, to the King. 
Consider, lords, he is the next of blood 
And heir apparent to the English crown. 
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west, 
What though the common people favour him, 
Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,' 
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!' 
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk, 
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently. Exit 
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal; 
Than all the princes in the land beside; 
Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal. 
Behoves it us to labour for the realm. 
Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal- 
More like a soldier than a man o' th' church, 
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal. 
Warwick my son, the comfort of my age, 
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons, 
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France 
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people: 
Join we together for the public good, 
The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal, 
While they do tend the profit of the land. 
WARWICK. So God help Warwick, as he loves the land 
SALISBURY. Then let's make haste away and look unto the main. 
WARWICK. Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost- 
YORK. Anjou and Maine are given to the French; 
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy 
Suffolk concluded on the articles; 
The peers agreed; and Henry was well pleas'd 
While as the silly owner of the goods 
Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland, 
As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt 
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon. 
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French! 
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts, 
And when I spy advantage, claim the crown, 
For that's the golden mark I seek to hit. 
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist, 
Nor wear the diadem upon his head, 
To pry into the secrets of the state; 
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars; 
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose, 
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd, 
And in my standard bear the arms of York, 
To grapple with the house of Lancaster; 
And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown, 
The DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S house 
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load? 
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows, 
As frowning at the favours of the world? 
Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth, 
Enchas'd with all the honours of the world? 
Until thy head be circled with the same. 
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold. 
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground. 
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts! 
But, as I think, it was by th' Cardinal; 
And on the pieces of the broken wand 
Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset 
In the cathedral church of Westminster, 
And on my head did set the diadem. 
Art thou not second woman in the realm, 
And the Protector's wife, belov'd of him? 
Above the reach or compass of thy thought? 
Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk. 
HUME. But, by the grace of God and Hume's advice, 
With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch of Eie, 
With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer? 
DUCHESS. It is enough; I'll think upon the questions; 
We'll see these things effected to the full. 
HUME. Hume must make merry with the Duchess' gold; 
The business asketh silent secrecy. 
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch: 
I dare not say from the rich Cardinal, 
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk; 
Have hired me to undermine the Duchess, 
Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal's broker.

Is this the fashions in the court of England? 
Is this the government of Britain's isle, 
And this the royalty of Albion's king?

And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France, 
His champions are the prophets and apostles; 
I would the college of the Cardinals

QUEEN. Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort 
The imperious churchman; Somerset, Buckingham, 
And grumbling York; and not the least of these 
But can do more in England than the King. 
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils; 
As that proud dame, the Lord Protector's wife. 
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies, 
Strangers in court do take her for the Queen. 
The very train of her worst wearing gown 
That she will light to listen to the lays, 
Although we fancy not the Cardinal, 
Yet must we join with him and with the lords, 
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint 
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.

Dispute not that; York is the worthier.

QUEEN. Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest; 
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales, 
London. The DUKE OF YORK'S garden 
The Nevils are thy subjects to command. 
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons; 
The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales; 
The second, William of Hatfield; and the third, 
Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster; 
The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York; 
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester; 
William of Windsor was the seventh and last. 
Edward the Black Prince died before his father 
Who, after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king 
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt, 
Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth, 
Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king, 
WARWICK. Father, the Duke hath told the truth; 
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown. 
For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead, 
The issue of the next son should have reign'd. 
YORK. The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line 
I claim the crown, had issue Philippe, a daughter, 
SALISBURY. This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke, 
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown; 
But, to the rest. 
My mother, being heir unto the crown, 
To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son, son. 
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir 
To Roger Earl of March, who was the son 
So, if the issue of the elder son 
Succeed before the younger, I am King. 
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt, 
The fourth son: York claims it from the third. 
And in this private plot be we the first 
With honour of his birthright to the crown. 
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster; 
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence, 
At Buckingham, and all the crew of them, 
Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock, 
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey; 
WARWICK. My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick 
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king. 
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick 
The greatest man in England but the King. Exeunt 
Sound trumpets. Enter the KING and State: the QUEEN, GLOUCESTER, YORK, 
SUFFOLK, and SALISBURY, with guard, to banish the DUCHESS. Enter, guarded, 
the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER, MARGERY JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWELL, and BOLINGBROKE 
Receive the sentence of the law for sins 
From thence unto the place of execution: 
The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes, 
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows. 
With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man. 
GLOUCESTER. Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee. 
I cannot justify whom the law condemns. 
Exeunt the DUCHESS and the other prisoners, guarded 
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground! 
Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm. 
As willingly do I the same resign 
This is the day appointed for the combat; 
And ready are the appellant and defendant, 
The armourer and his man, to enter the lists, 
So please your Highness to behold the fight. 
Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried. 
KING HENRY. A God's name, see the lists and all things fit; 
Here let them end it, and God defend the right! 
Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant, 
The servant of his armourer, my lords.

touching the Duke of York, I will take my death I never meant him 
any ill, nor the King, nor the Queen; and therefore, Peter, have 
Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants! 
YORK. Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in 
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow, 
GLOUCESTER. Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud, 
GLOUCESTER. Ten is the hour that was appointed me 
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess. 
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets 
The abject people gazing on thy face, 
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets. 
Enter the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER in a white sheet, 
STANLEY, the SHERIFF, and OFFICERS 
SERVING-MAN. So please your Grace, we'll take her from the sheriff. 
See how the giddy multitude do point 
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet, 
And when I start, the envious people laugh 
Trowest thou that e'er I'll look upon the world 
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun? 
And he a prince, and ruler of the land; 
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death 
But I in danger for the breach of law. 
Holden at Bury the first of this next month. 
Let not her penance exceed the King's commission. 
To take her with him to the Isle of Man. 
GLOUCESTER. Entreat her not the worse in that I pray 
You use her well; the world may laugh again, 
STANLEY. Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man, 
Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison. Exeunt

The Abbey at Bury St. Edmunds 
Sound a sennet. Enter the KING, the QUEEN, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, 
BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY, and WARWICK, to the Parliament 
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man, 
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance? 
We know the time since he was mild and affable, 
That all the court admir'd him for submission. 
But meet him now and be it in the morn, 
When every one will give the time of day, 
But great men tremble when the lion roars, 
And should you fall he is the next will mount; 
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts; 
Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted; 
Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden 
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry. 
The reverent care I bear unto my lord 
Made me collect these dangers in the Duke. 
I will subscribe, and say I wrong'd the Duke. 
The Duchess, by his subornation, 
As next the King he was successive heir- 
Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess 
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep, 
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb. 
Levy great sums of money through the realm 
By means whereof the towns each day revolted. 
KING HENRY. My lords, at once: the care you have of us, 
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove: 
The Duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given 
For he's disposed as the hateful raven. 
For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf. 
Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all 
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man. 
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud, 
GLOUCESTER. All happiness unto my lord the King! 
The purest spring is not so free from mud 
And, being Protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay; 
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay 
So help me God, as I have watch'd the night- 
That doit that e'er I wrested from the King, 
Because I would not tax the needy commons, 
Have I dispursed to the garrisons, 
Pity was all the fault that was in me; 
Above the felon or what trespass else. 
And prove the period of their tyranny, 
But mine is made the prologue to their play; 
The envious load that lies upon his heart; 
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon, 
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest, 
The ancient proverb will be well effected: 
And the offender granted scope of speech, 
QUEEN. But I can give the loser leave to chide. 
Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false! 
BUCKINGHAM. He'll wrest the sense, and hold us here all day. 
CARDINAL. Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure. 
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side, 
QUEEN. What, will your Highness leave the Parliament? 
The map of honour, truth, and loyalty! 
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come 
And as the butcher takes away the calf, 
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays, 
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house, 
And as the dam runs lowing up and down, 
Looking the way her harmless young one went, 
QUEEN. Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams: 
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile 
Or as the snake, roll'd in a flow'ring bank, 
That for the beauty thinks it excellent. 
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world 
To rid us from the fear we have of him. 
The King will labour still to save his life; 
The commons haply rise to save his life; 
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite 
As place Duke Humphrey for the King's Protector? 
QUEEN. So the poor chicken should be sure of death. 
To make the fox surveyor of the fold? 
By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock, 
Seeing the deed is meritorious, 
Say but the word, and I will be his priest. 
Say you consent and censure well the deed, 
I tender so the safety of my liege. 
SUFFOLK. Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing. 
And put the Englishmen unto the sword. 
Send succours, lords, and stop the rage betime, 
Before the wound do grow uncurable; 
Witness the fortune he hath had in France. 
Had been the Regent there instead of me, 
SOMERSET. And in the number, thee that wishest shame! 
Th' uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms 
And try your hap against the Irishmen? 
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey. 
And so break off; the day is almost spent. 
Resign to death- it is not worth th' enjoying. 
Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man 
My brain, more busy than the labouring spider, 
I fear me you but warm the starved snake, 
Until the golden circuit on my head, 
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams, 
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw. 
Under the tide of John Mortimer. 
And in the end being rescu'd, I have seen 
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells. 
Hath he conversed with the enemy, 
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind, 
How they affect the house and claim of York. 
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd; 
And Henry put apart, the next for me. Exit 
Enter two or three MURDERERS running over the stage, 
from the murder of DUKE HUMPHREY 
We have dispatch'd the Duke, as he commanded. 
The King and all the peers are here at hand. 
Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well, 
Sound trumpets. Enter the KING, the QUEEN, 
Where is our uncle? What's the matter, Suffolk? 
The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word. 
[The KING swoons] 
QUEEN. How fares my lord? Help, lords! The King is dead. 
SOMERSET. Rear up his body; wring him by the nose. 
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren, 
Can chase away the first conceived sound? 
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world. 
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight; 
For in the shade of death I shall find joy- 
Although the Duke was enemy to him, 
And all to have the noble Duke alive. 
What know I how the world may deem of me? 
It may be judg'd I made the Duke away; 
What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf? 
Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea, 
What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts, 
The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me, 
The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands 
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back, 
I stood upon the hatches in the storm; 
And when the dusky sky began to rob 
And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it; 
The agent of thy foul inconstancy- 
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means. 
The commons, like an angry hive of bees 
Until they hear the order of his death. 
With the rude multitude till I return. Exit 
Exit SALISBURY with the commons 
Bed put forth with the body. Enter WARWICK 
Upon the life of this thrice-famed Duke. 
WARWICK. See how the blood is settled in his face. 
Being all descended to the labouring heart, 
Who, in the conflict that it holds with death, 
Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy, 
Which with the heart there cools, and ne'er returneth 
To blush and beautify the cheek again. 
Look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking; 
Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged. 
The least of all these signs were probable. 
SUFFOLK. Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death? 
And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep. 
WARWICK. Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh, 
But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter? 
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest 
But may imagine how the bird was dead, 
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak? 
QUEEN. Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife? 
And never of the Nevils' noble race. 
WARWICK. But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee, 
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee, 
SUFFOLK. The trait'rous Warwick, with the men of Bury, 
SALISBURY. [To the Commons within] Sirs, stand apart, the King 
Dread lord, the commons send you word by me 
They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died; 
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal. 
COMMONS. [Within] An answer from the King, my Lord of Salisbury! 
SUFFOLK. 'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds, 
But all the honour Salisbury hath won 
Is that he was the lord ambassador 
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King. 
COMMONS. [Within] An answer from the King, or we will all break in! 
But three days longer, on the pain of death. 
The world shall not be ransom for thy life. 
There's two of you; the devil make a third, 
Would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan, 
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint, 
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste! 
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss, 
And boding screech-owls make the consort full! 
all the foul terrors in dark-seated hell- 
And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass, 
And turns the force of them upon thyself. 
Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from, 
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place 
That thou might'st think upon these by the seal, 
Once by the King and three times thrice by thee, 
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence; 
For where thou art, there is the world itself, 
With every several pleasure in the world; 
That makes him gasp, and stare, and catch the air, 
Were by his side; sometime he calls the King 
The secrets of his overcharged soul; 
QUEEN. Go tell this heavy message to the King. Exit VAUX 
And with the southern clouds contend in tears- 
Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows? 
Now get thee hence: the King, thou know'st, is coming; 
Here could I breathe my soul into the air, 
As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe 
SUFFOLK. A jewel, lock'd into the woefull'st cask 
Enter the KING, SALISBURY, and WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed 
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them. 
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary 
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him. 
KING HENRY. O Thou eternal Mover of the heavens, 
O, beat away the busy meddling fiend

Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close;

And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades

Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.

For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs, 
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,

WHITMORE. The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags? 
SUFFOLK. Ay, but these rags are no part of the Duke: 
The honourable blood of Lancaster, 
Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board, 
WHITMORE. Speak, Captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain? 
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks; 
For swallowing the treasure of the realm.

Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain, 
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell 
Unto the daughter of a worthless king,

And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home. 
The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all, 
And now the house of York- thrust from the crown

Now let the general trumpet blow his blast, 
The silver livery of advised age, 
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire; 
And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims, 
Meet I an infant of the house of York, 
Exit with the body 
The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset 
Hath made the wizard famous in his death. 
KING HENRY. Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay. 
To give the enemy way, and to secure us 
If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom 
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts. 
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth, 
By th' mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard: 
For, as I hear, the King is fled to London 
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.

London. The Parliament House 
WARWICK. I wonder how the King escap'd our hands. 
YORK. While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north, 
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland, 
Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself, 
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain. 
MONTAGUE. And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood, 
Whom I encount'red as the battles join'd. 
NORFOLK. Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt! 
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps, 
This is the palace of the fearful King, 
And this the regal seat. Possess it, York; 
WARWICK. And when the King comes, offer him no violence. 
YORK. The Queen this day here holds her parliament, 
WARWICK. The bloody parliament shall this be call'd, 
WARWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best, 
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster, 
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown. 
[YORK occupies the throne] 
KING HENRY. My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits, 
Even in the chair of state! Belike he means, 
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer, 
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king. 
CLIFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel. 
My gracious lord, here in the parliament 
Let us assail the family of York. 
KING HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them, 
EXETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly. 
KING HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart, 
To make a shambles of the parliament house! 
Shall be the war that Henry means to use. 
YORK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was. 
EXETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown. 
WARWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown 
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain. 
That we are those which chas'd you from the field, 
March'd through the city to the palace gates. 
YORK. Will you we show our title to the crown? 
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field. 
KING HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown? 
I am the son of Henry the Fifth, 
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop, 
KING HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I: 
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head. 
RICHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly. 
KING HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown. 
For Richard, in the view of many lords, 
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth, 
But that the next heir should succeed and reign. 
EXETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st, 
Can set the Duke up in despite of me. 
Or I will fill the house with armed men, 
And over the chair of state, where now he sits, 
[He stamps with his foot and the 
YORK. Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs, 
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease. 
CLIFFORD. What wrong is this unto the Prince your son! 
CLIFFORD. Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Be thou a prey unto the house of York 
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever; 
[Coming from the throne] 
MONTAGUE. And I unto the sea, from whence I came. 
Exeunt the YORKISTS 
KING HENRY. And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court. 
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and the PRINCE OF WALES 
EXETER. Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger. 
The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc'd me. 
And giv'n unto the house of York such head 
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown, 
Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais; 
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas; 
The Duke is made Protector of the realm; 
The trembling lamb environed with wolves. 
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes 
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours 
And utter ruin of the house of York. 
PRINCE OF WALES. When I return with victory from the field 
Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and the PRINCE 
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son! 
The loss of those three lords torments my heart. 
Come, cousin, you shall be the messenger. 
EDWARD. No, I can better play the orator. 
Enter the DUKE OF YORK 
The crown of England, father, which is yours. 
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe, 
It will outrun you, father, in the end. 
RICHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak. 
Henry had none, but did usurp the place; 
Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd 
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart. 
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk 
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise; 
And yet the King not privy to my drift, 
Nor any of the house of Lancaster? 
MESSENGER. The Queen with all the northern earls and lords 
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest, 
Whom we have left protectors of the King, 
The army of the Queen mean to besiege us. 
SIR JOHN. She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field. 
YORK. Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great, 
When as the enemy hath been ten to one; 
Why should I not now have the like success? Exeunt 
As for the brat of this accursed duke, 
RUTLAND. So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch 
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter. 
The sight of any of the house of York 
Another part of the field 
Alarum. Enter the DUKE OF YORK 
YORK. The army of the Queen hath got the field. 
And all my followers to the eager foe 
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind, 
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt 
And when the hardiest warriors did retire, 
With bootless labour swim against the tide 
Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue, 
The sands are numb'red that make up my life; 
the PRINCE OF WALES, and soldiers 
And made an evening at the noontide prick. 
YORK. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth 
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons; 
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers. 
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life. 
CLIFFORD. Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. So doth the cony struggle in the net. 
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand. 
The wanton Edward and the lusty George? 
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland? 
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood 
Made issue from the bosom of the boy; 
And rob his temples of the diadem, 
Off with the crown and with the crown his head; 
QUEEN MARGARET. Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes. 
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth! 
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, 
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, 
Unless the adage must be verified, 
The contrary doth make thee wond'red at. 
The want thereof makes thee abominable. 
As the Antipodes are unto us, 
Or as the south to the septentrion. 
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child, 
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, 
And when the rage allays, the rain begins. 
YORK. That face of his the hungry cannibals 
And I with tears do wash the blood away. 
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this; 
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right, 
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears; 
There, take the crown, and with the crown my curse; 
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world; 
Think but upon the wrong he did us all, 
So York may overlook the town of York. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news; 
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news; 
The happy tidings of his good escape. 
I saw him in the battle range about, 
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop 
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him. 
See how the morning opes her golden gates 
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun. 
How well resembles it the prime of youth, 
Not separated with the racking clouds, 
In this the heaven figures some event. 
EDWARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of. 
I think it cites us, brother, to the field, 
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet, 
And overshine the earth, as this the world. 
You love the breeder better than the male. 
When as the noble Duke of York was slain, 
And stood against them as the hope of Troy 
Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy. 
Hews down and fells the hardest-timber'd oak. 
But only slaught'red by the ireful arm 
Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen, 
Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite, 
The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks 
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood 
They took his head, and on the gates of York 
They set the same; and there it doth remain, 
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd. 
The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry; 
Might in the ground be closed up in rest! 
To weep is to make less the depth of grief. 
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun; 
The words would add more anguish than the wounds. 
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain! 
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death. 
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, 
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, 
I, then in London, keeper of the King, 
March'd toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen, 
Bearing the King in my behalf along; 
But whether 'twas the coldness of the King, 
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight 
And we in them no hope to win the day; 
So that we fled: the King unto the Queen; 
For in the marches here we heard you were 
EDWARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick? 
WARWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers; 
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head 
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist, 
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes 
If for the last, say 'Ay,' and to it, lords. 
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting Queen, 
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland, 
Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax. 
His oath enrolled in the parliament; 
And now to London all the crew are gone 
May make against the house of Lancaster. 
Now if the help of Norfolk and myself, 
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March, 
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure, 
And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!- 
The next degree is England's royal throne, 
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head. 
But sound the trumpets and about our task. 
MESSENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me 
The Queen is coming with a puissant host, 
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY, QUEEN MARGARET, the PRINCE OF WALES, CLIFFORD, 
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy 
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord? 
KING HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck- 
Not to the beast that would usurp their den. 
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick? 
Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? 
The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on, 
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy; 
KING HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator, 
For all the rest is held at such a rate 
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown, 
And in that quarrel use it to the death. 
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York, 
And in the towns, as they do march along, 
CLIFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field: 
The Queen hath best success when you are absent. 
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field? 
You that are King, though he do wear the crown, 
Who should succeed the father but the son? 
Or any he, the proudest of thy sort. 
RICHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight. 
WARWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown? 
WARWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence. 
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain 
The execution of my big-swol'n heart 
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed. 
CLIFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here 
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown. 
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided, 
Whose father bears the title of a king- 
As if a channel should be call'd the sea- 
His father revell'd in the heart of France, 
And tam'd the King, and made the Dauphin stoop; 
And we, in pity of the gentle King, 
We set the axe to thy usurping root; 
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves, 
Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak. 
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk, 
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance; 
And in the very pangs of death he cried, 
So, underneath the belly of their steeds, 
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost. 
WARWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood. 
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage, 
And look upon, as if the tragedy 
And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face 
As victors wear at the Olympian games. 
Another part of the field 
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York, 
This is the hand that stabbed thy father York; 
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland; 
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death 
To execute the like upon thyself; 
Another part of the field 
KING HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war, 
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, 
Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind; 
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea 
Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind. 
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind; 
Now one the better, then another best; 
So is the equal poise of this fell war. 
To whom God will, there be the victory! 
Have chid me from the battle, swearing both 
They prosper best of all when I am thence. 
Thereby to see the minutes how they run- 
How many makes the hour full complete, 
How many hours brings about the day, 
How many days will finish up the year, 
When this is known, then to divide the times- 
So many weeks ere the poor fools will can; 
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece: 
Pass'd over to the end they were created, 
Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade 
And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds, 
SON. Ill blows the wind that profits nobody. 
From London by the King was I press'd forth; 
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man, 
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master; 
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart 
The red rose and the white are on his face, 
The fatal colours of our striving houses: 
The one his purple blood right well resembles; 
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth. 
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish! 
KING HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances 
Misthink the King, and not be satisfied! 
Exit with the body 
Even for the loss of thee, having no more, 
Exit with the body 
Having the fearful flying hare in sight, 
Whither the Queen intends. Forward; away! Exeunt 
Another part of the field 
The common people swarm like summer flies; 
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun? 
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth! 
Giving no ground unto the house of York, 
The foe is merciless and will not pity; 
The air hath got into my deadly wounds, 
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest; 
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks. 
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded Queen 
Command an argosy to stern the waves. 
For, though before his face I speak the words, 
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave; 
EDWARD. And now the battle's ended, 
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch 
But set his murd'ring knife unto the root 
WARWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head, 
Instead whereof let this supply the room. 
Which in the time of death he gave our father. 
RICHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard 
This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood 
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst 
WARWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head, 
And rear it in the place your father's stands. 
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France, 
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen. 
The scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again; 
First will I see the coronation; 
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea 
And never will I undertake the thing 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
A chase in the north of England 
For through this laund anon the deer will come; 
Culling the principal of all the deer. 
SECOND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot. 
FIRST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow 
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost. 
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best; 
And, for the time shall not seem tedious, 
This is the quondam King; let's seize upon him. 
For wise men say it is the wisest course. 
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick 
Is thither gone to crave the French King's sister 
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn; 
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong, 
And in conclusion wins the King from her 
You are the king King Edward hath depos'd; 
And as the air blows it to me again, 
Commanded always by the greater gust, 
Such is the lightness of you common men. 
Go where you will, the King shall be commanded; 
FIRST KEEPER. We are true subjects to the King, King Edward. 
FIRST KEEPER. We charge you, in God's name and the King's, 
To go with us unto the officers. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
London. The palace 
His land then seiz'd on by the conqueror. 
Because in quarrel of the house of York 
The worthy gentleman did lose his life. 
I see the lady hath a thing to grant, 
Before the King will grant her humble suit. 
CLARENCE. [Aside to GLOUCESTER] He knows the game; how true he 
keeps the wind! 
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch. 
GLOUCESTER. He plies her hard; and much rain wears the marble. 
GLOUCESTER. The match is made; she seals it with a curtsy. 
KING EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean. 
LADY GREY. The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege. 
Accords not with the sadness of my suit. 
GLOUCESTER. The widow likes him not; she knits her brows. 
CLARENCE. He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom. 
To be the father unto many sons. 
GLOUCESTER. The ghostly father now hath done his shrift. 
GLOUCESTER. The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad. 
GLOUCESTER. That would be ten days' wonder at the least. 
GLOUCESTER. By so much is the wonder in extremes. 
KING EDWARD. See that he be convey'd unto the Tower. 
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him 
To cross me from the golden time I look for! 
The lustful Edward's title buried- 
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies, 
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence, 
So do I wish the crown, being so far off; 
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it; 
And so I say I'll cut the causes off, 
What other pleasure can the world afford? 
That carries no impression like the dam. 
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown, 
And yet I know not how to get the crown, 
That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns, 
Seeking a way and straying from the way 
Not knowing how to find the open air, 
Torment myself to catch the English crown; 
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall; 
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk; 
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor, 
I can add colours to the chameleon, 
And set the murderous Machiavel to school. 
France. The KING'S palace 
Flourish. Enter LEWIS the French King, his sister BONA, 
and the EARL of OXFORD. LEWIS sits, and riseth up again 
And with dishonour laid me on the ground, 
Usurps the regal title and the seat 
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret, 
LEWIS. Renowned Queen, with patience calm the storm, 
QUEEN MARGARET. The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe. 
LEWIS. The more I stay, the more I'll succour thee. 
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow! 
To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart; 
For though usurpers sway the rule a while 
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain; 
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth, 
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest; 
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth, 
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost 
All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten? 
But for the rest: you tell a pedigree 
WARWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right 
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere, 
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years, 
When nature brought him to the door of death? 
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster. 
WARWICK. And I the house of York. 
LEWIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye? 
WARWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate. 
Tell me for truth the measure of his love 
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground, 
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun, 
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain. 
Touching the jointure that your king must make, 
That Bona shall be wife to the English king. 
PRINCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king. 
But if your title to the crown be weak, 
Enter the POST 
I hope all's for the best. 
LEWIS. What, has your king married the Lady Grey? 
Is this th' alliance that he seeks with France? 
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss, 
Did I forget that by the house of York 
Did I let pass th' abuse done to my niece? 
Did I impale him with the regal crown? 
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame? 
And force the tyrant from his seat by war. 
I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake. 
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle: 
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, 
I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown, 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
London. The palace 
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey? 
SOMERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King. 
and others. Four stand on one side, and four on the other 
CLARENCE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick, 
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey 
About the marriage of the Lady Bona. 
MONTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France. 
Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas 
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford. 
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales 
Unto the brother of your loving bride. 
CLARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir 
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son, 
To play the broker in mine own behalf; 
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath. 
GLOUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more. 
'Go tell false Edward, the supposed king, 
I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.' 
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen? 
KING EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon. 
Than all the rest, discharg'd me with these words: 
KING EDWARD. Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words? 
CLARENCE. Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger. 
Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown. 
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen; 
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest, 
The common people by numbers swarm to us. 
His soldiers lurking in the towns about, 
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy; 
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds, 
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle, 
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader. 
Enter three WATCHMEN, to guard the KING'S tent 
The King by this is set him down to sleep. 
SECOND WATCHMAN. To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day, 
That with the King here resteth in his tent? 
FIRST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend. 
THIRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why commands the King 
While he himself keeps in the cold field? 
SECOND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous. 
WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and 
set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK 
and the rest following them 
The drum playing and trumpet sounding, re-enter WARWICK 
and the rest, bringing the KING out in his gown, 
sitting in a chair. GLOUCESTER and HASTINGS fly over the stage 
WARWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke. 
KING EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted, 
WARWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd. 
Nor how to study for the people's welfare, 
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel. 
But Henry now shall wear the English crown 
And be true King indeed; thou but the shadow. 
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him. 
WARWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do; 
And see him seated in the regal throne. Exeunt 
London. The palace 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, but the loss of his own royal person. 
Is new committed to the Bishop of York, 
Warwick may lose that now hath won the day. 
And I the rather wean me from despair 
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs, 
King Edward's fruit, true heir to th' English crown. 
To set the crown once more on Henry's head. 
Guess thou the rest: King Edward's friends must down. 
But to prevent the tyrant's violence- 
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary 
To save at least the heir of Edward's right. 
Into this chiefest thicket of the park. 
Thus stands the case: you know our King, my brother, 
Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands 
Under the colour of his usual game, 
HUNTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game. 
KING EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand. 
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, 
Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop's deer? 
GLOUCESTER. Brother, the time and case requireth haste; 
Your horse stands ready at the park corner. 
HASTINGS. To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders. 
And pray that I may repossess the crown. Exeunt 
London. The Tower 
EARL OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER, and attendants 
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat 
He was the author, thou the instrument. 
And that the people of this blessed land 
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown, 
For few men rightly temper with the stars; 
CLARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, 
To whom the heav'ns in thy nativity 
While he enjoys the honour and his ease. 
KING HENRY. But, with the first of all your chief affairs, 
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him 
In secret ambush on the forest side 
And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him; 
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst, 
OXFORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown, 
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down. 
KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest, 
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas, 
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York, 
GLOUCESTER. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this; 
For many men that stumble at the threshold 
Enter, on the walls, the MAYOR OF YORK and 
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves, 
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York. 
GLOUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose, 
He'll soon find means to make the body follow. 
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends. 
MAYOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd. 
HASTINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well, 
Enter, below, the MAYOR and two ALDERMEN 
But in the night or in the time of war. 
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys; 
For Edward will defend the town and thee, 
Our title to the crown, and only claim 
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest. 
[The drum begins to march] 
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd. 
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends. 
And Henry but usurps the diadem. 
SOLDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, 
ALL. Long live Edward the Fourth! 
And when the morning sun shall raise his car 
Above the border of this horizon, 
Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it beseems the 
Come on, brave soldiers; doubt not of the day, 
London. The palace 
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas 
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee. 
My sovereign, with the loving citizens, 
Like to his island girt in with the ocean 
OXFORD. [Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid 
Exeunt all but the KING and EXETER 
KING HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while. 
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field 
EXETER. The doubt is that he will seduce the rest. 
And, when the lion fawns upon the lamb, 
The lamb will never cease to follow him. 
KING EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence; 
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow. 
And swell so much the higher by their ebb. 
Hence with him to the Tower: let him not speak. 
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay, 
And take the great-grown traitor unawares. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Enter WARWICK, the MAYOR OF COVENTRY, two MESSENGERS, 
and others upon the walls 
WARWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford? 
Where is the post that came from Montague? 
The drum your Honour hears marcheth from Warwick. 
KING EDWARD. Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle. 
GLOUCESTER. See how the surly Warwick mans the wall. 
KING EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates, 
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York. 
GLOUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King; 
Or did he make the jest against his will? 
WARWICK. 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother. 
What is the body when the head is off? 
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten, 
The king was slily finger'd from the deck! 
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace, 
And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower. 
GLOUCESTER. Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down. 
Nay, when? Strike now, or else the iron cools. 
And with the other fling it at thy face, 
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood: 
[He and his forces enter the city] 
GLOUCESTER. The gates are open, let us enter too. 
If not, the city being but of small defence, 
We'll quietly rouse the traitors in the same. 
[He and his forces enter the city] 
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear. 
KING EDWARD. The harder match'd, the greater victory. 
[He and his forces enter the city] 
Have sold their lives unto the house of York; 
And thou shalt be the third, if this sword hold. 
More than the nature of a brother's love. 
CLARENCE. [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing 
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together, 
To bend the fatal instruments of war 
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears? 
KING EDWARD. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way. 
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory! 
That I must yield my body to the earth 
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. 
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, 
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, 
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, 
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun 
To search the secret treasons of the world; 
The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood, 
The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power; 
Even now we heard the news. Ah, couldst thou fly! 
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, 
OXFORD. Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power! 
Another part of the field 
Flourish. Enter KING in triumph; with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest 
But in the midst of this bright-shining day 
I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen 
And blow it to the source from whence it came; 
GLOUCESTER. The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong, 
We, having now the best at Barnet field, 
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away. Exeunt 
What though the mast be now blown overboard, 
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost, 
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood; 
Should leave the helm and, like a fearful lad, 
With tearful eyes add water to the sea 
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, 
Our slaught'red friends the tackles; what of these? 
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings? 
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge? 
We will not from the helm to sit and weep, 
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no, 
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair. 
All these the enemies to our poor bark. 
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink. 
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off, 
That there's no hop'd-for mercy with the brothers 
And make him of the like spirit to himself. 
Go home to bed and, like the owl by day, 
KING EDWARD. Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood 
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength, 
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night. 
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords. 
Ye see, I drink the water of my eye. 
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd, 
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil. 
Be valiant, and give signal to the fight. 
Another part of the field 
KING EDWARD. Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak. 
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to? 
Whilst I propose the self-same words to the 
GLOUCESTER. That you might still have worn the petticoat 
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster. 
KING EDWARD. Take that, the likeness of this railer here. 
GLOUCESTER. Why should she live to fill the world with words? 
GLOUCESTER. Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother. 
GLOUCESTER. The Tower! the Tower! Exit 
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse. 
To make a bloody supper in the Tower. 
Now march we hence. Discharge the common sort 
London. The Tower 
Enter KING HENRY and GLOUCESTER with the LIEUTENANT, on the walls 
KING HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf; 
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece, 
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife. 
GLOUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind: 
The thief doth fear each bush an officer. 
KING HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush 
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird, 
Have now the fatal object in my eye 
That taught his son the office of a fowl! 
And yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd. 
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy, 
Thy brother Edward; and thyself, the sea 
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born. 
The owl shriek'd at thy birth- an evil sign; 
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time; 
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top, 
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree. 
To signify thou cam'st to bite the world; 
And if the rest be true which I have heard, 
For this, amongst the rest, was I ordain'd. 
GLOUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster 
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted. 
See how my sword weeps for the poor King's death. 
From those that wish the downfall of our house! 
I came into the world with my legs forward. 
The midwife wonder'd; and the women cried 
That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog. 
Then, since the heavens have shap'd my body so, 
Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light, 
King Henry and the Prince his son are gone. 
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest; 
Exit with the body 
London. The palace 
HASTINGS, NURSE, with the Young PRINCE, and attendants 
Repurchas'd with the blood of enemies. 
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son; 
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound; 
With them the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague, 
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion 
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd. 
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night, 
That thou might'st repossess the crown in peace; 
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain. 
For yet I am not look'd on in the world. 
Work thou the way- and that shall execute. 
CLARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty 
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe. 
GLOUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st, 
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit. 
[Aside] To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master 
Reignier, her father, to the King of France 
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem, 
And now what rests but that we spend the time 
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?

London. The palace 
Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one door; at the other, 
the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and the LORD ABERGAVENNY 
Met in the vale of Andren. 
BUCKINGHAM. All the whole time 
The view of earthly glory; men might say, 
Became the next day's master, till the last 
Made former wonders its. To-day the French, 
Shone down the English; and to-morrow they 
As cherubins, an gilt; the madams too, 
The pride upon them, that their very labour 
Was cried incomparable; and th' ensuing night 
Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings, 
The noble spirits to arms, they did perform 
In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything 
To the disposing of it nought rebell'd; 
Order gave each thing view. The office did 
I mean, who set the body and the limbs 
NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion 
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York. 
BUCKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed 
Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun, 
And keep it from the earth. 
For high feats done to th' crown, neither allied 
The force of his own merit makes his way- 
A place next to the King. 
If not from hell, the devil is a niggard 
BUCKINGHAM. Why the devil, 
Without the privity o' th' King-t' appoint 
Who should attend on him? He makes up the file 
Of all the gentry; for the most part such 
The honourable board of council out, 
Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have 
The peace between the French and us not values 
The cost that did conclude it. 
After the hideous storm that follow'd, was 
Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded 
The sudden breach on't. 
For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd 
Th' ambassador is silenc'd? 
The state takes notice of the private difference 
Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you- 
The Cardinal's malice and his potency 
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before 
him, certain of the guard, and two SECRETARIES 
with papers. The CARDINAL in his passage fixeth his 
WOLSEY. The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor? Ha! 
Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best 
Ask God for temp'rance; that's th' appliance only 
He bores me with some trick. He's gone to th' King; 
BUCKINGHAM. I'll to the King, 
The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er 
If with the sap of reason you would quench 
Or but allay the fire of passion. 
Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but 
BUCKINGHAM. To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong 
As here at home, suggests the King our master 
To this last costly treaty, th' interview 
Did break i' th' wrenching. 
The articles o' th' combination drew 
As give a crutch to th' dead. But our Count-Cardinal 
To th' old dam treason: Charles the Emperor, 
Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt- 
His fears were that the interview betwixt 
Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor 
Ere it was ask'd-but when the way was made, 
And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd, 
That he would please to alter the King's course, 
And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know, 
As soon he shall by me, that thus the Cardinal 
and two or three of the guard 
My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl 
Arrest thee of high treason, in the name 
The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish 
The business present; 'tis his Highness' pleasure 
You shall to th' Tower. 
Which makes my whit'st part black. The will of heav'n 
[To ABERGAVENNY] The King 
Is pleas'd you shall to th' Tower, till you know 
ABERGAVENNY. As the Duke said, 
The will of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure 
The King t' attach Lord Montacute and the bodies 
Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car, 
These are the limbs o' th' plot; no more, I hope. 
BRANDON. A monk o' th' Chartreux. 
BUCKINGHAM. My surveyor is false. The o'er-great Cardinal 
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham, 
London. The Council Chamber 
Cornets. Enter KING HENRY, leaning on the CARDINAL'S shoulder, the NOBLES, 
and SIR THOMAS LOVELL, with others. The CARDINAL places himself 
under the KING'S feet on his right side 
KING. My life itself, and the best heart of it, 
Thanks you for this great care; I stood i' th' level 
And point by point the treasons of his master 
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' 
Enter the QUEEN, usher'd by the DUKES OF NORFOLK 
and SUFFOLK; she kneels. The KING riseth 
The other moiety ere you ask is given; 
The dignity of your office, is the point 
Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart 
Of these exactions, yet the King our master- 
The sides of loyalty, and almost appears 
The clothiers all, not able to maintain 
The many to them 'longing, have put of 
The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who 
Daring th' event to th' teeth, are all in uproar, 
Pertains to th' state, and front but in that file 
Most pestilent to th' hearing; and to bear 'em 
The back is sacrifice to th' load. They say 
The nature of it? In what kind, let's know, 
Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief 
The sixth part of his substance, to be levied 
Without delay; and the pretence for this 
By learned approbation of the judges. If I am 
The chronicles of my doing, let me say 
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake 
Our necessary actions in the fear 
From every tree lop, bark, and part o' th' timber; 
The air will drink the sap. To every county 
The force of this commission. Pray, look tot; 
WOLSEY. [Aside to the SECRETARY] A word with you. 
Of the King's grace and pardon. The grieved commons 
Further in the proceeding. Exit SECRETARY 
QUEEN KATHARINE. I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham 
The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker; 
Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt, 
Hath into monstrous habits put the graces 
The fore-recited practices, whereof 
Out of the Duke of Buckingham. 
It would infect his speech-that if the King 
To make the sceptre his. These very words 
Revenge upon the Cardinal. 
How grounded he his title to the crown 
The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish 
What was the speech among the Londoners 
Concerning the French journey. I replied 
Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious, 
To the King's danger. Presently the Duke 
Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted 
'Twould prove the verity of certain words 
Whom after under the confession's seal 
This pausingly ensu'd: "Neither the King nor's heirs, 
Tell you the Duke, shall prosper; bid him strive 
To gain the love o' th' commonalty; the Duke 
You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office 
On the complaint o' th' tenants. Take good heed 
I told my lord the Duke, by th' devil's illusions 
The monk might be deceiv'd, and that 'twas dangerous 
That, had the King in his last sickness fail'd, 
The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads 
After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke 
The Duke retain'd him his. But on: what hence? 
As to the Tower I thought-I would have play'd 
The part my father meant to act upon 
Th' usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury, 
SURVEYOR. After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,' 
Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none, 
He's traitor to th' height. Exeunt 
London. The palace 
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN and LORD SANDYS 
CHAMBERLAIN. Is't possible the spells of France should juggle 
CHAMBERLAIN. As far as I see, all the good our English 
Have got by the late voyage is but merely 
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones; 
That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin 
That sure th' have worn out Christendom. 
I hear of none but the new proclamation 
That's clapp'd upon the court gate. 
LOVELL. The reformation of our travell'd gallants, 
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors. 
And never see the Louvre. 
For so run the conditions, leave those remnants 
The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings, 
The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at. 
There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons 
SANDYS. The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going, 
LOVELL. To the Cardinal's; 
The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you. 
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us; 
London. The Presence Chamber in York Place 
Hautboys. A small table under a state for the Cardinal, 
a longer table for the guests. Then enter ANNE BULLEN, 
The very thought of this fair company 
SANDYS. Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal 
Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this. 
The penance lies on you if these fair ladies 
SANDYS. The red wine first must rise 
By all the laws of war y'are privileg'd. 
For so they seem. Th' have left their barge and landed, 
Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue; 
Hautboys. Enter the KING, and others, as maskers, 
habited like shepherds, usher'd by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN. 
They pass directly before the CARDINAL, 
Out of the great respect they bear to beauty, 
[They choose ladies. The KING chooses ANNE BULLEN] 
KING. The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty, 
[He whispers to the maskers] 
The Viscount Rochford-one of her Highness' women. 
WOLSEY. Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready 
I' th' privy chamber? 
In the next chamber. 
Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become 
Of the great Duke of Buckingham. 
That labour, sir. All's now done but the ceremony 
Of bringing back the prisoner. 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'll tell you in a little. The great Duke. 
Came to the bar; where to his accusations 
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law. 
The King's attorney, on the contrary, 
Urg'd on the examinations, proofs, confessions, 
Of divers witnesses; which the Duke desir'd 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. The same. 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. When he was brought again to th' bar to hear 
In all the rest show'd a most noble patience. 
He never was so womanish; the cause 
The Cardinal is the end of this. 
And generally: whoever the King favours 
The Cardinal instantly will find employment, 
SECOND GENTLEMAN. All the commons 
The mirror of all courtesy- 
before him; the axe with the edge towards him; halberds 
And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of. 
Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful! 
The law I bear no malice for my death: 
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice. 
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men, 
Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies 
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me 
Yet are the King's, and, till my soul forsake, 
LOVELL. To th' water side I must conduct your Grace; 
The Duke is coming; see the barge be ready; 
The greatness of his person. 
Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying 
Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all 
For ever from the world. I had my trial, 
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away 
Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour 
That were the authors. 
SECOND GENTLEMAN. If the Duke be guiltless, 
Between the King and Katharine? 
For when the King once heard it, out of anger 
He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight 
To stop the rumour and allay those tongues 
The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal 
To the good Queen, possess'd him with a scruple 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. 'Tis the Cardinal; 
And merely to revenge him on the Emperor 
The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos'd. 
SECOND GENTLEMAN. I think you have hit the mark; but is't 
That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal 
London. The palace 
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN reading this letter 
'The horses your lordship sent for, with all the care 
young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north. 
before a subject, if not before the King; which stopp'd 
Enter to the LORD CHAMBERLAIN the DUKES OF NORFOLK and SUFFOLK 
SUFFOLK. How is the King employ'd? 
NORFOLK. What's the cause? 
CHAMBERLAIN. It seems the marriage with his brother's wife 
This is the Cardinal's doing; the King-Cardinal, 
That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune, 
Turns what he list. The King will know him one day. 
And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league 
Between us and the Emperor, the Queen's great nephew, 
He dives into the King's soul and there scatters 
Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience, 
And out of all these to restore the King, 
That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls, 
Will bless the King-and is not this course pious? 
The French King's sister. Heaven will one day open 
The King's eyes, that so long have slept upon 
If the King please; his curses and his blessings 
Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in. 
And with some other business put the King 
The King has sent me otherwhere; besides, 
Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN; and the KING draws 
the curtain and sits reading pensively 
The quiet of my wounded conscience, 
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom. 
The Spaniard, tied by blood and favour to her, 
The trial just and noble. All the clerks, 
I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms 
Have their free voices. Rome the nurse of judgment, 
And thank the holy conclave for their loves. 
The court of Rome commanding-you, my Lord 
In the unpartial judging of this business. 
KING. Two equal men. The Queen shall be acquainted 
KING. Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour 
You are the King's now. 
KING. Deliver this with modesty to th' Queen. 
The most convenient place that I can think of 
London. The palace 
ANNE. Not for that neither. Here's the pang that pinches: 
So many courses of the sun enthroned, 
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which 
To give her the avaunt, it is a pity 
It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging 
ANNE. So much the more 
Saving your mincing, the capacity 
ANNE. No, not for all the riches under heaven. 
For all the world. 
No more to th' crown but that. Lo, who comes here? 
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN 
The secret of your conference? 
The action of good women; there is hope 
Ta'en of your many virtues, the King's Majesty 
I shall not fail t' approve the fair conceit 
The King hath of you. [Aside] I have perus'd her well: 
That they have caught the King; and who knows yet 
To lighten all this isle?-I'll to the King 
For all the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it? 
O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke! 
The Queen is comfortless, and we forgetful 
next them, two SCRIBES, in the habit of doctors; after them, 
the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY alone; after him, the BISHOPS OF LINCOLN, ELY, 
follows a GENTLEMAN bearing the purse, with the great seal, 
after them, side by side, the two CARDINALS, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS; 
two NOBLEMEN with the sword and mace. Then enter the KING and QUEEN 
and their trains. The KING takes place under the cloth of state; 
the two CARDINALS sit under him as judges. The QUEEN takes place 
some distance from the KING. The BISHOPS place themselves on each side 
of the court, in manner of consistory; below them the SCRIBES. 
The LORDS sit next the BISHOPS. The rest of the attendants stand 
in convenient order about the stage 
KING. What's the need? 
And on all sides th' authority allow'd; 
SCRIBE. Say 'Henry King of England, come into the court.' 
SCRIBE. Say 'Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.' 
The QUEEN makes no answer, rises out of her chair, 
goes about the court, comes to the KING, and kneels 
As I saw it inclin'd. When was the hour 
He was from thence discharg'd? Sir, call to mind 
With many children by you. If, in the course 
Turn me away and let the foul'st contempt 
To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir, 
The King, your father, was reputed for 
The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many 
I will implore. If not, i' th' name of God, 
Yea, the elect o' th' land, who are assembled 
That longer you desire the court, as well 
What is unsettled in the King. 
The daughter of a king, my drops of tears 
Have stood to charity and display'd th' effects 
By a commission from the Consistory, 
Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me 
The King is present; if it be known to him 
It lies to cure me, and the cure is to 
Remove these thoughts from you; the which before 
Before you all, appeal unto the Pope, 
[She curtsies to the KING, and offers to depart] 
CAMPEIUS. The Queen is obstinate, 
CRIER. Katharine Queen of England, come into the court. 
When you are call'd, return. Now the Lord help! 
That man i' th' world who shall report he has 
The queen of earthly queens. She's noble born; 
Induce you to the question on't, or ever 
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might 
Be to the prejudice of her present state, 
The Queen is put in anger. Y'are excus'd. 
Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desir'd 
The passages made toward it. On my honour, 
Then mark th' inducement. Thus it came-give heed to't: 
By th' Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador, 
Who had been hither sent on the debating 
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and 
Our daughter Mary. I' th' progress of this business, 
I mean the Bishop-did require a respite 
Wherein he might the King his lord advertise 
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager, 
The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me, 
The region of my breast, which forc'd such way 
I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had 
The grave does to the dead; for her male issue 
Well worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not 
I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in 
The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer 
By all the reverend fathers of the land 
The question did at first so stagger me- 
The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt, 
For no dislike i' th' world against the person 
Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points 
Katharine our queen, before the primest creature 
That's paragon'd o' th' world. 
The Queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness 
Made to the Queen to call back her appeal 
My comfort comes along. -Break up the court;

GENTLEMAN. An't please your Grace, the two great Cardinals 
Wait in the presence. 
Enter the two CARDINALS, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS 
I would be all, against the worst may happen. 
The full cause of our coming. 
As not to know the language I have liv'd in; 
The willing'st sin I ever yet committed 
We come not by the way of accusation 
How you stand minded in the weighty difference 
Between the King and you, and to deliver, 
The last fit of my greatness-good your Graces, 
WOLSEY. Madam, you wrong the King's love with these fears; 
CAMPEIUS. Put your main cause into the King's protection; 
For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye 
QUEEN KATHARINE. The more shame for ye; holy men I thought ye, 
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady- 
The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye. 
You turn the good we offer into envy. 
And all the fellowship I hold now with him 
Still met the King, lov'd him next heav'n, obey'd him, 
WOLSEY. Madam, you wander from the good we aim at. 
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it! 
I am the most unhappy woman living. 
Almost no grave allow'd me. Like the My, 
That once was mistress of the field, and flourish'd, 
The way of our profession is against it; 
Grow from the King's acquaintance, by this carriage. 
The hearts of princes kiss obedience, 
Such doubts as false coin from it. The King loves you; 
London. The palace 
Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK, the DUKE OF SUFFOLK, the EARL OF SURREY, 
and the LORD CHAMBERLAIN 
And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal 
The offer of this time, I cannot promise 
To meet the least occasion that may give me 
Remembrance of my father-in-law, the Duke, 
SUFFOLK. Which of the peers

What we can do to him-though now the time 
Bar his access to th' King, never attempt 
Over the King in's tongue. 
His spell in that is out; the King hath found 
The honey of his language. No, he's settled, 
In the divorce his contrary proceedings

And came to th' eye o' th' King; wherein was read 
How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness 
To stay the judgment o' th' divorce; for if 
A creature of the Queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.' 
SURREY. Has the King this? 
CHAMBERLAIN. The King in this perceives him how he coasts 
After his patient's death: the King already 
Hath married the fair lady. 
Trace the conjunction! 
SURREY. But will the King 
Digest this letter of the Cardinal's? 
The Lord forbid! 
Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius 
Has left the cause o' th' King unhandled, and 
Is posted, as the agent of our Cardinal, 
The King cried 'Ha!' at this. 
Have satisfied the King for his divorce, 
In the King's business. 
The Cardinal! 
WOLSEY. The packet, Cromwell, 
Gave't you the King? 
WOLSEY. Look'd he o' th' inside of the paper? 
He did unseal them; and the first he view'd,

The French King's sister; he shall marry her. 
To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!

The master-cord on's heart! 
SUFFOLK. The King, the King! 
To his own portion! And what expense by th' hour 
Seems to flow from him! How, i' th' name of thrift, 
Saw you the Cardinal? 
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground, 
His eye against the moon. In most strange postures 
The several parcels of his plate, his treasure, 
Some spirit put this paper in the packet 
His contemplation were above the earth 
His thinkings are below the moon, not worth 
[The KING takes his seat and whispers LOVELL, 
who goes to the CARDINAL] 
You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory 
Of your best graces in your mind; the which 
To think upon the part of business which 
I bear i' th' state; and nature does require 
SURREY. [Aside] The Lord increase this business! 
The prime man of the state? I pray you tell me 
To th' good of your most sacred person and 
The profit of the state. For your great graces 
Therein illustrated; the honour of it 
Does pay the act of it, as, i' th' contrary, 
The foulness is the punishment. I presume 
Though all the world should crack their duty to you, 
As doth a rock against the chiding flood, 
Should the approach of this wild river break, 
Exit the KING, frowning upon the CARDINAL; the NOBLES 
Leap'd from his eyes; so looks the chafed lion 
Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him- 
I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so; 
This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' account 
For mine own ends; indeed to gain the popedom, 
Made me put this main secret in the packet 
I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this? 
Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.' 
The letter, as I live, with all the business 
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness, 
Like a bright exhalation in the evening, 
Re-enter to WOLSEY the DUKES OF NORFOLK and 
SUFFOLK, the EARL OF SURREY, and the LORD 
NORFOLK. Hear the King's pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you 
To render up the great seal presently 
Bearing the King's will from his mouth expressly? 
You ask with such a violence, the King- 
Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours, 
SURREY. The King, that gave it. 
The heads of all thy brother cardinals, 
Far from his succour, from the King, from all 
That might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him; 
I answer is most false. The Duke by law 
That in the way of loyalty and truth 
Toward the King, my ever royal master, 
My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords 
Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one, 
The goodness of your intercepted packets 
You writ to th' Pope against the King; your goodness, 
As you respect the common good, the state 
Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles 
Worse than the sacring bell, when the brown wench 
NORFOLK. Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand; 
When the King knows my truth. 
First, that without the King's assent or knowledge 
You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops. 
Was still inscrib'd; in which you brought the King 
SUFFOLK. Then, that without the knowledge 
Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold 
To carry into Flanders the great seal. 
Without the King's will or the state's allowance, 
Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King's coin. 
To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways 
You have for dignities, to the mere undoing 
Of all the kingdom. Many more there are, 
His faults lie open to the laws; let them, 
SUFFOLK. Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is- 
Fall into th' compass of a praemunire- 
Out of the King's protection. This is my charge. 
About the giving back the great seal to us, 
The King shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you. 
WOLSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me. 
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth 
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms 
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost, 
Weary and old with service, to the mercy 
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me, 
CROMWELL. The heaviest and the worst 
Is your displeasure with the King. 
CROMWELL. The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen 
CROMWELL. Last, that the Lady Anne, 
Whom the King hath in secrecy long married, 
Going to chapel; and the voice is now 
WOLSEY. There was the weight that pull'd me down. 
The King has gone beyond me. All my glories 
Or gild again the noble troops that waited 
To be thy lord and master. Seek the King; 
The King shall have my service; but my prayers 
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman. 
Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory, 
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour, 
By that sin fell the angels. How can man then, 
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it? 
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's, 
Serve the King, and-prithee lead me in. 
To the last penny; 'tis the King's. My robe, 
Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal 
The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwell. Exeunt

Of the Cinque-ports. 
I take it she that carries up the train 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. It is; and all the rest are countesses. 
THIRD GENTLEMAN. Among the crowds i' th' Abbey, where a finger 
With the mere rankness of their joy. 
The ceremony? 
THIRD GENTLEMAN. Well worth the seeing. 
THIRD GENTLEMAN. As well as I am able. The rich stream 
Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen 
To a prepar'd place in the choir, fell of 
The beauty of her person to the people. 
Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman 
That ever lay by man; which when the people 
Had the full view of, such a noise arose 
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest, 
In the old time of war, would shake the press, 
Came to the altar, where she kneel'd, and saintlike 
Then rose again, and bow'd her to the people; 
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury 
She had all the royal makings of a queen: 
The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems 
Laid nobly on her; which perform'd, the choir, 
With all the choicest music of the kingdom, 
And with the same full state pac'd back again 
To York Place, where the feast is held. 
For since the Cardinal fell that title's lost. 
'Tis now the King's, and called Whitehall. 
But 'tis so lately alter'd that the old name 
Were those that went on each side of the Queen? 
THIRD GENTLEMAN. Stokesly and Gardiner: the one of Winchester, 
Newly preferr'd from the King's secretary; 
The other, London. 
Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop's, 
The virtuous Cranmer. 
THIRD GENTLEMAN. All the land knows that; 
A man in much esteem with th' King, and truly 
A worthy friend. The King has made him Master 
O' th' jewel House, 
And one, already, of the Privy Council. 
Is to th' court, and there ye shall be my guests: 
My legs like loaden branches bow to th' earth, 
That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, 
Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't. 
GRIFFITH. Well, the voice goes, madam; 
For after the stout Earl Northumberland 
Lodg'd in the abbey; where the reverend abbot, 
An old man, broken with the storms of state, 
About the hour of eight-which he himself 
He gave his honours to the world again, 
Tied all the kingdom. Simony was fair play; 
His own opinion was his law. I' th' presence

And found the blessedness of being little.

Then the two that held the garland deliver the 
same to the other next two, who observe the same

her head; which done, they deliver the same garland 
to the last two, who likewise observe the same order;

You should be Lord Ambassador from the Emperor,

The King's request that I would visit you, 
Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter 
This to my lord the King. 
The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter- 
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!- 
For virtue and true beauty of the soul, 
The last is for my men-they are the poorest, 
These are the whole contents; and, good my lord, 
By that you love the dearest in this world, 
Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the King

The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury; 
Is this the honour they do one another? 
And at the door too, like a post with packets.

The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury. 
CRANMER approaches the Council table 
Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling 
The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains- 
Till they obey the manage. If we suffer, 
Of the whole state; as of late days our neighbours, 
The upper Germany, can dearly witness,

And the strong course of my authority 
Might go one way, and safely; and the end 
Pray heaven the King may never find a heart

From hence you be committed to the Tower; 
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience, 
That's the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers, 
You be convey'd to th' Tower a prisoner; 
There to remain till the King's further pleasure 
But I must needs to th' Tower, my lords?

The King will suffer but the little finger 
Against this man-whose honesty the devil

Upon the maiden virtue of the crown. 
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time 
And this is Geffrey's. In the name of God, 
Which owe the crown that thou o'er-masterest? 
To look into the blots and stains of right. 
That thou mayst be a queen and check the world! 
BASTARD. Hear the crier. 
AUSTRIA. What the devil art thou? 
BASTARD. One that will play the devil, sir, with you, 
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes, 
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard; 
That did disrobe the lion of that robe! 
BASTARD. It lies as sightly on the back of him 
King John, this is the very sum of all: 
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win. 
The dominations, royalties, and rights, 
The canon of the law is laid on him, 
Being but the second generation 
But God hath made her sin and her the plague 
Her injury the beadle to her sin; 
All punish'd in the person of this child, 
A will that bars the title of thy son. 
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls 
Trumpet sounds. Enter citizens upon the walls 
CITIZEN. Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls? 
Before the eye and prospect of your town, 
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath, 
By the compulsion of their ordinance 
But on the sight of us your lawful king, 
Behold, the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle; 
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right 
Son to the elder brother of this man, 
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal 
In the relief of this oppressed child 
Against th' invulnerable clouds of heaven; 
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls 
Or shall we give the signal to our rage, 
CITIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects; 
KING JOHN. Acknowledge then the King, and let me in. 
CITIZEN. That can we not; but he that proves the King, 
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world. 
KING JOHN. Doth not the crown of England prove the King? 
We for the worthiest hold the right from both. 
KING JOHN. Then God forgive the sin of all those souls 
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet 
BASTARD. Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since 
BASTARD. O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar! 
KING JOHN. Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth 
BASTARD. Speed then to take advantage of the field. 
KING PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill 
Command the rest to stand. God and our right! Exeunt 
Here, after excursions, enter the HERALD OF FRANCE, 
with trumpets, to the gates 
Who by the hand of France this day hath made 
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground; 
Coldly embracing the discoloured earth; 
Upon the dancing banners of the French, 
Dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes. 
Open your gates and give the victors way. 
From first to last the onset and retire 
Enter the two KINGS, with their powers, at several doors 
Say, shall the current of our right run on? 
A peaceful progress to the ocean. 
That sways the earth this climate overlooks, 
Or add a royal number to the dead, 
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss 
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings. 
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire! 
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs; 
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men, 
Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field, 
The other's peace. Till then, blows, blood, and death! 
KING JOHN. Whose party do the townsmen yet admit? 
CITIZEN. The King of England, when we know the King. 
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem, 
Their battering cannon, charged to the mouths, 
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city. 
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air. 
To whom in favour she shall give the day, 
Smacks it not something of the policy? 
KING JOHN. Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads, 
And lay this Angiers even with the ground; 
BASTARD. An if thou hast the mettle of a king, 
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery, 
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground, 
KING JOHN. We from the west will send destruction 
AUSTRIA. I from the north. 
KING PHILIP. Our thunder from the south 
That here come sacrifices for the field. 
CITIZEN. That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch, 
Is niece to England; look upon the years 
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid. 
Is the young Dauphin every way complete- 
He is the half part of a blessed man, 
Do glorify the banks that bound them in; 
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope 
The sea enraged is not half so deaf, 
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death 
He gives the bastinado with his tongue; 
Thy now unsur'd assurance to the crown 
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit. 
I see a yielding in the looks of France; 
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath 
CITIZEN. Why answer not the double majesties 
KING JOHN. If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son, 
And all that we upon this side the sea- 
Holds hand with any princess of the world. 
KING PHILIP. What say'st thou, boy? Look in the lady's face. 
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye; 
Which, being but the shadow of your son, 
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye. 
BASTARD. [Aside] Drawn in the flattering table of her eye, 
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow, 
The rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd. 
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop? 
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance; 
If not fill up the measure of her will, 
Exeunt all but the BASTARD 
John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole, 
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field 
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear 
That broker that still breaks the pate of faith, 
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that; 
Commodity, the bias of the world- 
The world, who of itself is peised well, 
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France, 
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand 
Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
France. The FRENCH KING'S camp 
Is but the vain breath of a common man: 
I have a king's oath to the contrary. 
As doth the fury of two desperate men 
Which in the very meeting fall and die! 
But spoke the harm that is by others done? 
And with the half-blown rose; but Fortune, O! 
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs. 
I may not go without you to the kings. 
To me, and to the state of my great grief, 
That no supporter but the huge firm earth 
Can hold it up. [Seats herself on the ground] 
ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and attendants 
To solemnize this day the glorious sun 
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist, 
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold. 
The yearly course that brings this day about 
Among the high tides in the calendar? 
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week, 
To curse the fair proceedings of this day. 
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war 
Let not the hours of this ungodly day 
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset, 
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side! 
KING PHILIP. Here comes the holy legate of the Pope. 
And from Pope Innocent the legate here, 
Why thou against the Church, our holy mother, 
Can task the free breath of a sacred king? 
To charge me to an answer, as the Pope. 
Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England 
Without th' assistance of a mortal hand. 
So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart 
KING JOHN. Though you and all the kings of Christendom 
Dreading the curse that money may buy out, 
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust, 
Though you and all the rest, so grossly led, 
Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes. 
PANDULPH. Then by the lawful power that I have 
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law; 
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse? 
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic, 
And raise the power of France upon his head, 
AUSTRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal. 
KING JOHN. Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal? 
CONSTANCE. What should he say, but as the Cardinal? 
LEWIS. Bethink you, father; for the difference 
Or the light loss of England for a friend. 
Forgo the easier. 
BLANCH. That's the curse of Rome. 
CONSTANCE. O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here 
BLANCH. The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith, 
Which only lives but by the death of faith, 
KING JOHN. The King is mov'd, and answers not to this. 
And the conjunction of our inward souls 
The latest breath that gave the sound of words 
The fearful difference of incensed kings. 
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed 
And make a riot on the gentle brow 
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse- 
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue, 
A chafed lion by the mortal paw, 
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth, 
That is, to be the champion of our Church. 
The truth is then most done not doing it; 
The better act of purposes mistook 
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd. 
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st, 
And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth 
Against an oath; the truth thou art unsure 
The peril of our curses fight on thee 
But in despair die under the black weight. 
Against the blood that thou hast married? 
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom 
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife? 
BASTARD. Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time, 
BLANCH. The sun's o'ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu! 
Which is the side that I must go withal? 
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine; 
Assured loss before the match be play'd. 
The blood, and dearest-valu'd blood, of France. 
Alarums, excursions. Enter the BASTARD with AUSTRIA'S head 
Some airy devil hovers in the sky 
the BASTARD, HUBERT, and LORDS 
KING JOHN. [To the BASTARD] Cousin, away for England! haste 
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags 
Set at liberty; the fat ribs of peace 
Must by the hungry now be fed upon. 
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day, 
Attended with the pleasures of the world, 
To give me audience. If the midnight bell 
Sound on into the drowsy race of night; 
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins, 
France. The FRENCH KING's camp 
KING PHILIP. So by a roaring tempest on the flood 
Holding th' eternal spirit, against her will, 
In the vile prison of afflicted breath. 
CONSTANCE. Lo now! now see the issue of your peace! 
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night, 
O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth! 
Then with a passion would I shake the world, 
The different plague of each calamity. 
In the fair multitude of those her hairs! 
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child, 
And chase the native beauty from his cheek, 
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven 
CONSTANCE. Grief fills the room up of my absent child, 
My life, my joy, my food, my ail the world! 
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man; 
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste, 
PANDULPH. Before the curing of a strong disease, 
Even in the instant of repair and health, 
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave 
For even the breath of what I mean to speak 
Out of the path which shall directly lead 
The misplac'd John should entertain an hour, 
PANDULPH. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife, 
May then make all the claim that Arthur did. 
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you; 
This act, so evilly borne, shall cool the hearts 
No natural exhalation in the sky, 
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts 
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change, 
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of john. 
Than I have nam'd! The bastard Faulconbridge 
Is now in England ransacking the Church, 
Go with me to the King. 'Tis wonderful 
For England go; I will whet on the King. 
If you say ay, the King will not say no. Exeunt 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Within the arras. When I strike my foot 
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth 
And bind the boy which you shall find with me 
Fast to the chair. Be heedful; hence, and watch. 
EXECUTIONER. I hope your warrant will bear out the deed. 
I should be as merry as the day is long; 
ARTHUR. Have you the heart? When your head did but ache, 
The best I had, a princess wrought it me- 
And, like the watchful minutes to the hour, 
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time, 
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot, 
Even in the matter of mine innocence; 
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men. 
HUBERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here. 
Nor look upon the iron angrily; 
ARTHUR. Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues 
Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold 
ARTHUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief, 
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out, 
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes. 
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world, 
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt; 
Fresh expectation troubled not the land 
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily, 
To throw a perfume on the violet, 
To smooth the ice, or add another hue 
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light 
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish, 
And, in the last repeating, troublesome, 
SALISBURY. In this the antique and well-noted face 
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about, 
Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse, 
Discredit more in hiding of the fault 
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd. 
PEMBROKE. Then I, as one that am the tongue of these, 
To sound the purposes of all their hearts, 
Your safety, for the which myself and them 
Th' enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint 
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent 
The steps of wrong-should move you to mew up 
The rich advantage of good exercise? 
That the time's enemies may not have this 
PEMBROKE. This is the man should do the bloody deed: 
The image of a wicked heinous fault 
Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast, 
SALISBURY. The colour of the King doth come and go 
PEMBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence 
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death. 
The suit which you demand is gone and dead: 
Before the child himself felt he was sick. 
Think you I bear the shears of destiny? 
Have I commandment on the pulse of life? 
And find th' inheritance of this poor child, 
That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle 
Three foot of it doth hold-bad world the while! 
Was levied in the body of a land. 
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them, 
The tidings comes that they are all arriv'd. 
Is stopp'd with dust: the first of April died 
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died 
MESSENGER. Under the Dauphin. 
Enter the BASTARD and PETER OF POMFRET 
Now! What says the world 
BASTARD. But if you be afear'd to hear the worst, 
Then let the worst, unheard, fall on your head. 
Under the tide; but now I breathe again 
Aloft the flood, and can give audience 
BASTARD. How I have sped among the clergymen 
The sums I have collected shall express. 
But as I travell'd hither through the land, 
I find the people strangely fantasied; 
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found 
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon, 
PETER. Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so. 
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arriv'd? 
BASTARD. The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it; 
And others more, going to seek the grave 
KING JOHN. Nay, but make haste; the better foot before. 
BASTARD. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed. 
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers; 
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about 
The other four in wondrous motion. 
HUBERT. Old men and beldams in the streets 
And whisper one another in the ear; 
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist, 
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool, 
KING JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be attended 
To break within the bloody house of life, 
And on the winking of authority 
To understand a law; to know the meaning 
KING JOHN. O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth 
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds 
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd, 
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name. 
Nay, in the body of the fleshly land, 
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood. 
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought 
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind 
KING JOHN. Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers, 
Forgive the comment that my passion made 
The angry lords with all expedient haste. 
England. Before the castle 
Enter ARTHUR, on the walls 
ARTHUR. The wall is high, and yet will I leap down. 
This gentle offer of the perilous time. 
PEMBROKE. Who brought that letter from the Cardinal? 
SALISBURY. The Count Melun, a noble lord of France, 
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love 
Enter the BASTARD 
The King by me requests your presence straight. 
SALISBURY. The King hath dispossess'd himself of us. 
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot 
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks. 
Return and tell him so. We know the worst. 
SALISBURY. This is the prison. What is he lies here? 
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed. 
Form such another? This is the very top, 
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest, 
Of murder's arms; this is the bloodiest shame, 
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke, 
Presented to the tears of soft remorse. 
To the yet unbegotten sin of times, 
The graceless action of a heavy hand, 
If that it be the work of any hand. 
SALISBURY. If that it be the work of any hand! 
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand; 
The practice and the purpose of the King; 
The incense of a vow, a holy vow, 
Never to taste the pleasures of the world, 
By giving it the worship of revenge. 
Arthur doth live; the King hath sent for you. 
SALISBURY. Must I rob the law? [Drawing his sword] 
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence; 
BASTARD. Keep the peace, I say. 
BASTARD. Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury. 
That you shall think the devil is come from hell. 
Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house; 
BIGOT. Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there! 
PEMBROKE. There tell the King he may inquire us out. 
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach 
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread 
And it shall be as all the ocean, 
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath 
Among the thorns and dangers of this world. 
The life, the right, and truth of all this realm 
To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth 
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state. 
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty 
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace; 
The imminent decay of wrested pomp. 
And follow me with speed. I'll to the King; 
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land. Exeunt 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
The circle of my glory. 
PANDULPH. [Gives back the crown] Take again 
From this my hand, as holding of the Pope, 
KING JOHN. Now keep your holy word; go meet the French; 
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul 
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick 
Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope; 
Upon your oath of service to the Pope, 
Go I to make the French lay down their arms. Exit 
KING JOHN. Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet 
Enter the BASTARD 
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers. 
The little number of your doubtful friends. 
BASTARD. They found him dead, and cast into the streets, 
An empty casket, where the jewel of life 
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust 
Govern the motion of a kingly eye. 
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire; 
Threaten the threat'ner, and outface the brow 
That borrow their behaviours from the great, 
The dauntless spirit of resolution. 
Away, and glister like the god of war 
When he intendeth to become the field; 
What, shall they seek the lion in his den, 
To meet displeasure farther from the doors 
KING JOHN. The legate of the Pope hath been with me, 
And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers 
Led by the Dauphin. 
Shall we, upon the footing of our land, 
Mocking the air with colours idly spread, 
Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace; 
KING JOHN. Have thou the ordering of this present time. 
England. The DAUPHIN'S camp at Saint Edmundsbury 
Return the precedent to these lords again, 
May know wherefore we took the sacrament, 
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound 
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury! 
But such is the infection of the time 
That, for the health and physic of our right, 
We cannot deal but with the very hand 
That we, the sons and children of this isle, 
Upon the spot of this enforced cause- 
To grace the gentry of a land remote 
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself 
The blood of malice in a vein of league, 
This show'r, blown up by tempest of the soul, 
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven 
That never saw the giant world enrag'd, 
Into the purse of rich prosperity 
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine. 
Look where the holy legate comes apace, 
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven 
And on our actions set the name of right 
The next is this: King John hath reconcil'd 
That so stood out against the holy Church, 
The great metropolis and see of Rome. 
And tame the savage spirit of wild war, 
It may lie gently at the foot of peace 
To any sovereign state throughout the world. 
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars 
You taught me how to know the face of right, 
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed, 
Have I not here the best cards for the game 
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set? 
PANDULPH. You look but on the outside of this work. 
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world 
Even in the jaws of danger and of death. 
Enter the BASTARD, attended 
BASTARD. According to the fair play of the world, 
My holy lord of Milan, from the King 
And, as you answer, I do know the scope 
PANDULPH. The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite, 
BASTARD. By all the blood that ever fury breath'd, 
The youth says well. Now hear our English King; 
The King doth smile at; and is well prepar'd 
From out the circle of his territories. 
That hand which had the strength, even at your door. 
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch, 
Even at the crying of your nation's crow, 
No. Know the gallant monarch is in arms 
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb 
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war, 
And echo with the clamour of thy drum, 
As loud as thine, rattle the welkin's ear 
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder; for at hand- 
To feast upon whole thousands of the French. 
England. The field of battle 
KING JOHN. How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert. 
Desires your Majesty to leave the field 
KING JOHN. Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there. 
MESSENGER. Be of good comfort; for the great supply 
That was expected by the Dauphin here 
The French fight coldly, and retire themselves. 
England. Another part of the battlefield 
SALISBURY. I did not think the King so stor'd with friends. 
PEMBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French; 
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day. 
PEMBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field. 
MELUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here. 
PEMBROKE. It is the Count Melun. 
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion, 
For if the French be lords of this loud day, 
He means to recompense the pains you take 
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury; 
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire? 
What in the world should make me now deceive, 
Since I must lose the use of all deceit? 
I say again, if Lewis do will the day, 
Behold another day break in the east; 
Already smokes about the burning crest 
Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun, 
Paying the fine of rated treachery 
If Lewis by your assistance win the day. 
The love of him-and this respect besides, 
From forth the noise and rumour of the field, 
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts 
But I do love the favour and the form 
Of this most fair occasion, by the which 
We will untread the steps of damned flight, 
For I do see the cruel pangs of death 
England. The French camp 
LEWIS. The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set, 
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush, 
Last in the field and almost lords of it! 
MESSENGER. Where is my prince, the Dauphin? 
MESSENGER. The Count Melun is slain; the English lords 
The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs? 
The day shall not be up so soon as I 
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow. Exeunt 
Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT, severally 
HUBERT. Of the part of England. 
I come one way of the Plantagenets. 
Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear. 
HUBERT. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night 
BASTARD. Brief, then; and what's the news? 
HUBERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night, 
BASTARD. Show me the very wound of this ill news; 
HUBERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk; 
The better arm you to the sudden time 
Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King 
HUBERT. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back, 
At whose request the King hath pardon'd them, 
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide- 
Away, before! conduct me to the King; 
The orchard at Swinstead Abbey 
PRINCE HENRY. It is too late; the life of all his blood 
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house, 
Doth by the idle comments that it makes 
Foretell the ending of mortality. 
That, being brought into the open air, 
It would allay the burning quality 
PRINCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here. 
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts, 
Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds 
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan 
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings 
And none of you will bid the winter come 
Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north 
KING JOHN. The salt in them is hot. 
Within me is a hell; and there the poison 
Enter the BASTARD 
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burnt, 
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail 
BASTARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward, 
For in a night the best part of my pow'r, 
Were in the Washes all unwarily 
Devoured by the unexpected flood. [The KING dies] 
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay, 
To do the office for thee of revenge, 
Out of the weak door of our fainting land. 
The Dauphin rages at our very heels. 
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest, 
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin, 
BASTARD. He will the rather do it when he sees 
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel 
To the disposing of the Cardinal; 
The lineal state and glory of the land! 
SALISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make, 
BASTARD. O, let us pay the time but needful woe, 
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror, 
Come the three corners of the world in arms,

Assemble all the poor men of your sort, 
Into the channel, till the lowest stream 
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all. 
Go you down that way towards the Capitol; 
This way will I. Disrobe the images 
You know it is the feast of Lupercal. 
And drive away the vulgar from the streets; 
Who else would soar above the view of men 
Flourish. Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia, Portia, 
The barren, touched in this holy chase, 
CAESAR. Who is it in the press that calls on me? 
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, 
SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March. 
BRUTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March. 
CASSIUS. Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar. 
SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March. 
CASSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course? 
I turn the trouble of my countenance 
Forgets the shows of love to other men. 
BRUTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself 
Where many of the best respect in Rome, 
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. 
BRUTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people 
If it be aught toward the general good, 
Set honor in one eye and death i' the other 
For let the gods so speed me as I love 
The name of honor more than I fear death. 
Well, honor is the subject of my story. 
Endure the winter's cold as well as he. 
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, 
And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word, 
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it 
But ere we could arrive the point proposed, 
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder 
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber 
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man 
And when the fit was on him I did mark 
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world 
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans 
So get the start of the majestic world 
And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. 
CASSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world 
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, 
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; 
Now, in the names of all the gods at once, 
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! 
When went there by an age since the great flood 
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome 
BRUTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. 
CASSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, 
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow, 
And all the rest look like a chidden train: 
As we have seen him in the Capitol, 
CASSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is. 
I do not know the man I should avoid 
Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, 
CASCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me? 
he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the 
BRUTUS. What was the second noise for? 
CASSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? 
BRUTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice? 
CASSIUS. Who offered him the crown? 
BRUTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. 
CASCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was 
the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he 
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands 
stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had 
and receiving the bad air. 
CASCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was 
BRUTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness. 
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. 
down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him 
the players in the theatre, I am no true man. 
CASCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common 
herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet 
might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came 
CASCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face 
the eating. 
CASSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. 
Writings, all tending to the great opinion 
CASCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth 
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds 
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen 
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam 
To be exalted with the threatening clouds, 
Or else the world too saucy with the gods 
Against the Capitol I met a lion, 
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets. 
And yesterday the bird of night did sit 
Even at noonday upon the marketplace, 
Unto the climate that they point upon. 
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. 
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow? 
CASCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so? 
CASSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults. 
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets, 
Submitting me unto the perilous night, 
Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone; 
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open 
The breast of heaven, I did present myself 
Even in the aim and very flash of it. 
CASCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? 
It is the part of men to fear and tremble 
When the most mighty gods by tokens send 
To see the strange impatience of the heavens. 
But if you would consider the true cause 
As doth the lion in the Capitol, 
But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead, 
CASCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow 
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; 
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; 
If I know this, know all the world besides, 
The power to cancel his captivity. 
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep. 
For the base matter to illuminate 
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans 
There is no stir or walking in the streets, 
And the complexion of the element 
In favor's like the work we have in hand, 
But win the noble Brutus to our party- 
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair, 
Is ours already, and the man entire 
Upon the next encounter yields him ours. 
CASCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts, 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
I cannot, by the progress of the stars, 
But for the general. He would be crown'd: 
How that might change his nature, there's the question. 
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder 
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins 
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; 
But when he once attains the upmost round, 
He then unto the ladder turns his back, 
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees 
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel 
Will bear no color for the thing he is, 
And kill him in the shell. 
LUCIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir. 
Searching the window for a flint I found 
Gives him the letter. 
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March? 
BRUTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word. 
BRUTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air 
Opens the letter and reads. 
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome 
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king. 
If the redress will follow, thou receivest 
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus! 
BRUTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks. 
Between the acting of a dreadful thing 
And the first motion, all the interim is 
The genius and the mortal instruments 
Are then in council, and the state of man, 
The nature of an insurrection. 
LUCIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door, 
They are the faction. O Conspiracy, 
Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, 
DECIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here? 
That fret the clouds are messengers of day. 
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, 
Which is a great way growing on the south, 
Weighing the youthful season of the year. 
Some two months hence up higher toward the north 
He first presents his fire, and the high east 
Stands as the Capitol, directly here. 
BRUTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men, 
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse- 
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, 
Than secret Romans that have spoke the word 
The even virtue of our enterprise, 
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits, 
If he do break the smallest particle 
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs 
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, 
And in the spirit of men there is no blood. 
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, 
Which so appearing to the common eyes, 
For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar- 
BRUTUS. Peace, count the clock. 
CASSIUS. The clock hath stricken three. 
Quite from the main opinion he held once 
The unaccustom'd terror of this night, 
And the persuasion of his augurers 
May hold him from the Capitol today. 
For I can give his humor the true bent, 
And I will bring him to the Capitol. 
BRUTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most? 
CINNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then. 
CASSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus, 
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber; 
Which busy care draws in the brains of men; 
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning. 
And when I ask'd you what the matter was, 
He would embrace the means to come by it. 
To walk unbraced and suck up the humors 
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick, 
To dare the vile contagion of the night 
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air 
Which by the right and virtue of my place 
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, 
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs 
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops 
Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience 
The secrets of my heart. 
All the charactery of my sad brows. 
Any exploit worthy the name of honor. 
LIGARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before, 
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do? 
CAESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, 
CAESAR. Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me 
The face of Caesar, they are vanished. 
Besides the things that we have heard and seen, 
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. 
A lioness hath whelped in the streets; 
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds, 
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol; 
The noise of battle hurtled in the air, 
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. 
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? 
Are to the world in general as to Caesar. 
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. 
The valiant never taste of death but once. 
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, 
What say the augurers? 
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, 
They could not find a heart within the beast. 
CAESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice. 
And I the elder and more terrible. 
That keeps you in the house and not your own. 
We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House, 
I come to fetch you to the Senate House. 
To bear my greeting to the senators 
To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth? 
CAESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come, 
That is enough to satisfy the Senate. 
And know it now, the Senate have concluded 
"Break up the Senate till another time,

The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon! Exeunt.

Out of the teeth of emulation. 
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive. Exit. 
Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus. 
PORTIA. I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House; 
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else? 
And the wind brings it from the Capitol. 
Enter the Soothsayer. 
SOOTHSAYER. About the ninth hour, lady. 
PORTIA. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol? 
To see him pass on to the Capitol. 
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow, 
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, 
The heart of woman is! O Brutus, 
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise! 
Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit

Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above. 
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer. 
CAESAR. The ides of March are come. 
CAESAR. What, is the fellow mad? 
CASSIUS. What, urge you your petitions in the street? 
Come to the Capitol. 
Caesar goes up to the Senate House, the rest follow. 
He draws Mark Antony out of the way. 
CINNA. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. 
Might fire the blood of ordinary men 
Into the law of children. Be not fond 
That will be thaw'd from the true quality 
For the repealing of my banish'd brother? 
But I am constant as the northern star, 
There is no fellow in the firmament. 
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks; 
So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men, 
Yet in the number I do know but one 
Casca first, then the other Conspirators 
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. 
CASSIUS. Some to the common pulpits and cry out 
CASCA. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. 
CASSIUS. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people 
But we the doers. 
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time 
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords; 
Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, 
No worthier than the dust! 
So often shall the knot of us be call'd 
The men that gave their country liberty. 
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. 
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus 
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state 
Falls shrewdly to the purpose. 
With the most noble blood of all this world. 
The choice and master spirits of this age. 
And this the bleeding business they have done. 
And pity to the general wrong of Rome- 
In the disposing of new dignities. 
The multitude, beside themselves with fear, 
And then we will deliver you the cause 
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, 
Most noble! In the presence of thy corse? 
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, 
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee. 
The enemies of Caesar shall say this: 
Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar. 
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, 
Produce his body to the marketplace, 
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, 
Speak in the order of his funeral. 
Know you how much the people may be moved 
I will myself into the pulpit first, 
And show the reason of our Caesar's death. 
In the same pulpit whereto I am going, 
BRUTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us. 
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man 
That ever lived in the tide of times. 
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! 
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) 
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; 
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; 
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war; 
Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war, 
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth 
O Caesar! Sees the body. 
Into the marketplace. There shall I try, 
In my oration, how the people take 
The cruel issue of these bloody men, 
According to the which thou shalt discourse 
To young Octavius of the state of things. 
The Forum. 
Cassius, go you into the other street 
And part the numbers. 
Brutus goes into the pulpit.

than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is

no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a 
place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With this I 
depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I 
have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country 
THIRD CITIZEN. Let him go up into the public chair; 
Goes into the pulpit. 
The evil that men do lives after them, 
The good is oft interred with their bones; 
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus 
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest- 
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. 
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; 
You all did see that on the Lupercal 
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, 
SECOND CITIZEN. If thou consider rightly of the matter, 
FOURTH CITIZEN. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown; 
ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might 
Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, 
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, 
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar; 
Let but the commons hear this testament- 
FOURTH CITIZEN. We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. 
ALL. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will. 
And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, 
FOURTH CITIZEN. Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony. 
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will. 
I fear I wrong the honorable men 
ALL. The will! The testament! 
SECOND CITIZEN. They were villains, murtherers. The will! 
Read the will! 
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will? 
Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar, 
And let me show you him that made the will. 
He comes down from the pulpit. 
FIRST CITIZEN. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body. 
The first time ever Caesar put it on; 
That day he overcame the Nervii. 
See what a rent the envious Casca made; 
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd; 
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it, 
This was the most unkindest cut of all; 
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, 
Even at the base of Pompey's statue, 
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell. 
The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. 
FIRST CITIZEN. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. 
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech, 
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. 
FIRST CITIZEN. We'll burn the house of Brutus. 
THIRD CITIZEN. Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators. 
You have forgot the will I told you of. 
ALL. Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will. 
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal. 
We'll burn his body in the holy place 
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses. 
Take up the body. 
Exeunt Citizens with the body. 
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. 
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people, 
Enter Cinna the poet. 
CINNA. Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol. 
CINNA. I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet. 
CINNA. I am not Cinna the conspirator.

Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine 
OCTAVIUS. Or here, or at the Capitol. Exit Lepidus. 
The three-fold world divided, he should stand 
One of the three to share it? 
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, 
To groan and sweat under the business, 
Either led or driven, as we point the way; 
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears 
OCTAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake, 
LUCILIUS. Give the word, ho, and stand. 
But when they should endure the bloody spur, 
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on? 
The greater part, the horse in general, 
BRUTUS. Stand, ho! Speak the word along. 
Before the eyes of both our armies here, 
BRUTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man 
For taking bribes here of the Sardians, 
Because I knew the man, were slighted off. 
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last. 
BRUTUS. The name of Cassius honors this corruption, 
BRUTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember. 
That struck the foremost man of all this world 
And sell the mighty space of our large honors 
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, 
Under your testy humor? By the gods, 
You shall digest the venom of your spleen, 
That they pass by me as the idle wind 
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash 
For Cassius is aweary of the world: 
That carries anger as the flint bears fire, 
BRUTUS. What's the matter? 
POET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals. 
CASSIUS. How now, what's the matter? 
What should the wars do with these jigging fools? 
BRUTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders 
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup; 
MESSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure. 
MESSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell: 
I have the patience to endure it now. 
'Tis better that the enemy seek us; 
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground 
The enemy, marching along by them, 
That we have tried the utmost of our friends, 
The enemy increaseth every day; 
We, at the height, are ready to decline. 
There is a tide in the affairs of men 
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune; 
Omitted, all the voyage of their life 
And we must take the current when it serves, 
BRUTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk, 
This was an ill beginning of the night. 
Re-enter Lucius, with the gown. 
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument? 
LUCIUS. Here in the tent. 
Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so; 
I put it in the pocket of my gown. 
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down 
Enter the Ghost of Caesar. 
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes 
LUCIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.

The plains of Philippi. 
You said the enemy would not come down, 
But keep the hills and upper regions. 
The enemy comes on in gallant show; 
Upon the left hand of the even field. 
OCTAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left. 
Make forth, the generals would have some words. 
OCTAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal. 
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart, 
The posture of your blows are yet unknown; 
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees, 
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar. 
Strooke Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers! 
OCTAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat, 
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. 
When think you that the sword goes up again? 
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors. 
BRUTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, 
If you dare fight today, come to the field; 
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard. 
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. 
The gods today stand friendly that we may, 
But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain, 
Let's reason with the worst that may befall. 
The very last time we shall speak together. 
BRUTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy 
By which I did blame Cato for the death 
The time of life- arming myself with patience 
To stay the providence of some high powers 
Thorough the streets of Rome? 
Must end that work the ides of March begun. 
The end of this day's business ere it come! 
But it sufficeth that the day will end, 
And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away! Exeunt. 
The field of battle. 
Unto the legions on the other side. Loud alarum. 
And sudden push gives them the overthrow. 
Another part of the field. 
CASSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly! 
I slew the coward, and did take it from him. 
TITINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, 
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire? 
And tell me what thou notest about the field. 
Pindarus ascends the hill. 
With horsemen, that make to him on the spur; 
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts; 
Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou art 
Even with the sword that kill'd thee. Dies. 
MESSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground? 
TITINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart! 
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone; 
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men 
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived, 
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee! 
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report 
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus 
And I will seek for Pindarus the while. Exit Messala. 
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well! 
And come, young Cato; let us to the field. 
Another part of the field. 
I will proclaim my name about the field. 
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! 
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! 
FIRST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general. 
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus; 
The gods defend him from so great a shame! 
Another part of the field. 
CLITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord, 
BRUTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word: 
CLITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world. 
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me 
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes; 
Our enemies have beat us to the pit; Low alarums. 
Lucilius, and the Army. 
STRATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala: 
The conquerors can but make a fire of him; 
STRATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it. 
That did the latest service to my master. 
ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all. 
All the conspirators, save only he, 
His life was gentle, and the elements 
And say to all the world, "This was a man!" 
So call the field to rest, and let's away, 
To part the glories of this happy day. Exeunt.

Who were the opposites of this day's strife.

To pluck the common bosom on his side 
Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen, 
My reason all the same; and they are ready

Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,

Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours, 
And from th' extremest upward of thy head 
To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,

The wheel is come full circle; I am here. 
How have you known the miseries of your father? 
The bloody proclamation to escape 
That with the pain of death would hourly die 
(Alack, too weak the conflict to support!) 
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him 
His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life 
Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,

It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead! 
This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble 
The time will not allow the compliment 
Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia? 
The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in. 
The one the other poisoned for my sake,

Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia. 
Edg. To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send 
Give it the Captain. 
To hang Cordelia in the prison and 
To lay the blame upon her own despair 
Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile. 
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone, 
Kent. Is this the promis'd end? 
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee. 
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion 
Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight. 
Kent. The same- 
Kent. No, my good lord; I am the very man- 
During the life of this old Majesty, 
The wages of their virtue, and all foes 
The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see! 
That would upon the rack of this tough world

Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright

At the first op'ning of the gorgeous east, 
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast? 
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow 
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty 
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues- 
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy. 
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine! 
KING. O paradox! Black is the badge of hell, 
The hue of dungeons, and the school of night; 
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well. 
Her favour turns the fashion of the days; 
BEROWNE. O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes, 
The street should see as she walk'd overhead. 
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil! 
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth. 
Have found the ground of study's excellence 
Without the beauty of a woman's face? 
They are the ground, the books, the academes, 
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire. 
The nimble spirits in the arteries, 
The sinewy vigour of the traveller. 
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes, 
And study too, the causer of your vow; 
For where is author in the world 
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes 
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain; 
Lives not alone immured in the brain, 
But with the motion of all elements 
It adds a precious seeing to the eye: 
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound, 
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd. 
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails: 
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides? 
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods 
Make heaven drowsy with the harmony. 
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire; 
They are the books, the arts, the academes, 
That show, contain, and nourish, all the world, 
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women; 
For charity itself fulfils the law,

ARMADO. Sir, it is the King's most sweet pleasure and affection to

Enter the PRINCESS, MARIA, KATHARINE, and ROSALINE 
Look you what I have from the loving King. 
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all, 
ROSALINE. That was the way to make his godhead wax; 
KATHARINE. You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff; 
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument. 
ROSALINE. Look what you do, you do it still i' th' dark. 
The numbers true, and, were the numb'ring too, 
I were the fairest goddess on the ground. 
ROSALINE. Much in the letters; nothing in the praise. 
The letter is too long by half a mile. 
The chain were longer and the letter short? 
O that I knew he were but in by th' week! 
And wait the season, and observe the times, 
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school, 
ROSALINE. The blood of youth burns not with such excess 
As fool'ry in the wise when wit doth dote, 
Since all the power thereof it doth apply 
BOYET. Under the cool shade of a sycamore 
The King and his companions; warily 
'For' quoth the King 'an angel shalt thou see; 
The boy replied 'An angel is not evil; 
With that all laugh'd, and clapp'd him on the shoulder, 
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder. 
The third he caper'd, and cried 'All goes well.' 
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell. 
With that they all did tumble on the ground, 
PRINCESS OF FRANCE. And will they so? The gallants shall be task'd, 
And not a man of them shall have the grace, 
And then the King will court thee for his dear; 
ROSALINE. Come on, then, wear the favours most in sight. 
PRINCESS OF FRANCE. The effect of my intent is to cross theirs. 
Upon the next occasion that we meet 
PRINCESS OF FRANCE. No, to the death, we will not move a foot, 
BOYET. Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart, 
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out. 
BOYET. The trumpet sounds; be mask'd; the maskers come. 
[The LADIES mask] 
Enter BLACKAMOORS music, MOTH as Prologue, the 
KING and his LORDS as maskers, in the guise of Russians 
MOTH. All hail, the richest heauties on the earth! 
MOTH. A holy parcel of the fairest dames 
[The LADIES turn their backs to him] 
BOYET. What would you with the Princess? 
The measure, then, of one is eas'ly told. 
And many miles, the Princess bids you tell 
Are numb'red in the travel of one mile? 
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face, 
Thou now requests but moonshine in the water. 
Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon. 
ROSALINE. You took the moon at full; but now she's changed. 
KING. Yet still she is the Moon, and I the Man. 
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it. 
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends. 
LONGAVILLE. I know the reason, lady, why you ask. 
KATHARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf? 
LONGAVILLE. Let's part the word. 
KATHARINE. Bleat softly, then; the butcher hears you cry. 
BOYET. The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen 
As is the razor's edge invisible, 
Above the sense of sense; so sensible 
Are these the breed of wits so wondered at? 
The King was weeping-ripe for a good word. 
But will you hear? The King is my love sworn. 
BOYET. Ladies, withdraw; the gallants are at hand. 
Re-enter the KING, BEROWNE, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, 
KING. Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess? 
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know, 
Have not the grace to grace it with such show. 
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve; 
This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice, 
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice 
Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet; 
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet. 
This is the flow'r that smiles on every one, 
Pay him the due of 'honey-tongued Boyet.' 
Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET; ROSALINE, 
The virtue of your eye must break my oath. 
As the unsullied lily, I protest, 
My lady, to the manner of the days, 
ROSALINE. All the fool mine? 
ROSALINE. Which of the vizards was it that you wore? 
That hid the worse and show'd the better face. 
BEROWNE. Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury. 
Nor to the motion of a school-boy's tongue, 
By this white glove- how white the hand, God knows!- 
Of the old rage; bear with me, I am sick; 
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes. 
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see. 
PRINCESS OF FRANCE. The fairest is confession. 
KING. That more than all the world I did respect her. 
What did the Russian whisper in your ear? 
PRINCESS OF FRANCE. God give thee joy of him! The noble lord 
KING. My faith and this the Princess I did give; 
I see the trick on't: here was a consent, 
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick 
The ladies did change favours; and then we, 
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she. 
Do not you know my lady's foot by th' squier, 
And laugh upon the apple of her eye? 
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire, 
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no? 
COSTARD. O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors, sir, will 
say, but to parfect one man in one poor man, Pompion the Great, 
BEROWNE. Art thou one of the Worthies? 
COSTARD. It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompey the Great; 
for mine own part, I know not the degree of the Worthy; but I am

Dies in the zeal of that which it presents.

Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the Great; the parish curate, 
Alexander; Arinado's page, Hercules; the pedant, Judas 
These four will change habits and present the other five.

The temple-haunting martlet, does approve 
By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath 
The air is delicate. 
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, 
And the late dignities heap'd up to them, 
DUNCAN. Where's the Thane of Cawdor? 
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose 
the stage. Then enter Macbeth. 
It were done quickly. If the assassination 
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch, 
Might be the be-all and the end-all -here, 
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases 
To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice 
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice 
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, 
Who should against his murtherer shut the door, 
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan 
The deep damnation of his taking-off, 
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed 
Upon the sightless couriers of the air, 
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, 
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur 
To prick the sides of my intent, but only 
And falls on the other. 
LADY MACBETH. He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber? 
LADY MACBETH. Was the hope drunk 
To be the same in thine own act and valor 
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life 
Like the poor cat i' the adage? 
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place 
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me- 
And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you 
But screw your courage to the sticking-place 
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey 
That memory, the warder of the brain, 
Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason 
The unguarded Duncan? What not put upon 
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt 
Away, and mock the time with fairest show: 
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

MACBETH. I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise? 
LADY MACBETH. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. 
Who lies i' the second chamber? 
MACBETH. One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other, 
Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep, 
Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care, 
The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, 
MACBETH. Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house; 
Why did you bring these daggers from the place? 
The sleepy grooms with blood. 
Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead 
Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood

Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death,

Clamor'd the livelong night. Some say the earth

The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo! 
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell. Bell rings. 
LADY MACBETH. What's the business, 
The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak! 
The repetition in a woman's ear 
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees 
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood 
Is stopped, the very source of it is stopp'd.

For ruin's wasteful entrance; there, the murtherers, 
Steep'd in the colors of their trade, their daggers

In the great hand of God I stand, and thence

Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters 
When first they put the name of King upon me 
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, 
For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd, 
Put rancors in the vessel of my peace 
Given to the common enemy of man, 
To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings! 
Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list, 
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there? 
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.

All by the name of dogs. The valued file

The housekeeper, the hunter, every one 
According to the gift which bounteous nature 
Particular addition, from the bill 
Now if you have a station in the file, 
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it, 
Grapples you to the heart and love of us, 
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world 
I do to spite the world. 
Who I myself struck down. And thence it is 
Masking the business from the common eye 
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time, 
The moment on't; fort must be done tonight 
And something from the palace (always thought 
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work- 
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate

LADY MACBETH. Say to the King I would attend his leisure 
MACBETH. We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it. 
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, 
In the affliction of these terrible dreams 
That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, 
Than on the torture of the mind to lie 
Unsafe the while, that we 
Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown

MACBETH. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, 
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, 
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, 
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow 
Makes wing to the rooky wood; 
A park near the palace. 
To the direction just. 
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day; 
Now spurs the lated traveler apace 
To gain the timely inn, and near approaches 
The subject of our watch. 
SECOND MURTHERER. Then 'tis he; the rest 
That are within the note of expectation 
Already are i' the court. 
So all men do -from hence to the palace gate 
THIRD MURTHERER. Who did strike out the light? 
FIRST MURTHERER. Wast not the way? 
THIRD MURTHERER. There's but one down; the son is fled. 
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared. 
And last the hearty welcome. 
And play the humble host. 
Enter first Murtherer to the door. 
Both sides are even; here I'll sit i' the midst. 
The table round. [Approaches the door.] There's blood upon thy

That did the like for Fleance. If thou didst it, 
Thou art the nonpareil. 
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, 
As broad and general as the casing air; 
The least a death to nature. 
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled 
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow 
You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold 
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; 
The Ghost of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeth's place. 
Were the graced person of our Banquo present, 
MACBETH. The table's full. 
The fit is momentary; upon a thought 
Which might appal the devil. 
This is the very painting of your fear; 
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said 
Shall be the maws of kites. Exit Ghost. 
MACBETH. Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, 
Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal; 
Too terrible for the ear. The time has been, 
That, when the brains were out, the man would die, 
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table, 
LORDS. Our duties and the pledge. 
MACBETH. Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee! 
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. 
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, 
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger; 
And dare me to the desert with thy sword. 
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! 
LADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, 
Even to the disposition that I owe 
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks 
Stand not upon the order of your going, 
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night? 
MACBETH. I hear it by the way, but I will send. 
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters. 
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good 
LADY MACBETH. You lack the season of all natures, sleep. 
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use. 
Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate. 
And I, the mistress of your charms, 
The close contriver of all harms, 
Or show the glory of our art? 
And at the pit of Acheron 
Meet me i' the morning. Thither he 
I am for the air; this night I'll spend 
Upon the corner of the moon 
As by the strength of their illusion 
Forres. The palace. 
Thing's have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan 
And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late, 
Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous 
In pious rage, the two delinquents tear

To hear the men deny't. So that, I say, 
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear, 
LORD. The son of Duncan, 
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, 
Lives in the English court and is received 
Of the most pious Edward with such grace

Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid 
That by the help of these, with Him above

A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder. 
Enter the three Witches. 
FIRST WITCH. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd. 
SECOND WITCH. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined. 
FIRST WITCH. Round about the cauldron go; 
In the poison'd entrails throw. 
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot. 
In the cauldron boil and bake; 
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark, 
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark, 
Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse, 
Make the gruel thick and slab. 
For the ingredients of our cawdron. 
Then the charm is firm and good. 
Enter Hecate to the other three Witches. 
And everyone shall share i' the gains. 
And now about the cauldron sing, 
SECOND WITCH. By the pricking of my thumbs, 
Though you untie the winds and let them fight 
Against the churches, though the yesty waves 
Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure 
From the murtherer's gibbet throw 
Into the flame. 
Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough. 
More potent than the first. 
The power of man, for none of woman born 
That rises like the issue of a king, 
And wears upon his baby brow the round 
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree 
Rebellion's head, rise never till the Wood 
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath 
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; 
MACBETH. Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo Down! 
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first. 
A third is like the former. Filthy hags! 
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom? 
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass 
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me, 
And show the best of our delights. 
I'll charm the air to give a sound, 
Music. The Witches dance and 
Stand ay accursed in the calendar! 
MACBETH. Saw you the weird sisters? 
MACBETH. Infected be the 'air whereon they ride, 
The galloping of horse. Who wast came by? 
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook 
Unless the deed go with it. From this moment 
The very firstlings of my heart shall be 
The firstlings of my hand. And even now, 
The castle of Macduff I will surprise, 
Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword 
LADY MACDUFF. What had he done, to make him fly the land? 
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren, 
The most diminutive of birds, will fight, 
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. 
All is the fear and nothing is the love; 
As little is the wisdom, where the flight 
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further; 
But cruel are the times when we are traitors 
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward 
LADY MACDUFF. Poor bird! Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime, 
The pitfall nor the gin. 
LADY MACDUFF. Why, the honest men. 
SON. Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and 
swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them. 
England. Before the King's palace. 
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men 
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds 
As I shall find the time to friend, I will. 
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell. 
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, 
The title is affeer'd. Fare thee well, lord. 
I would not be the villain that thou think'st 
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp 
And the rich East to boot. 
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; 
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head, 
All the particulars of vice so grafted 
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state 
MACDUFF. Not in the legions 
The cestern of my lust, and my desire 
The untimely emptying of the happy throne, 
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink. 
I should cut off the nobles for their lands, 
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, 
The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear; 
MALCOLM. But I have none. The king-becoming graces, 
In the division of each several crime, 
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, 
Uproar the universal peace, confound 
Since that the truest issue of thy throne 
Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee, 
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts 
The taints and blames I laid upon myself, 
The devil to his fellow, and delight 
Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness 
MALCOLM. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth, I pray you? 
The great assay of art, but at his touch, 
MACDUFF. What's the disease he means? 
MALCOLM. 'Tis call'd the evil: 
All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, 
The mere despair of surgery, he cures, 
To the succeeding royalty he leaves 
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue 
The means that makes us strangers! 
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air, 
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell 
Expire before the flowers in their caps, 
MALCOLM. What's the newest grief? 
ROSS. That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker; 
MACDUFF. The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace? 
ROSS. When I came hither to transport the tidings, 
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather, 
For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot. 
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland 
This comfort with the like! But I have words 
That would be howl'd out in the desert air, 
The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief 
But in it shares some woe, though the main part 
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound 
Savagely slaughter'd. To relate the manner 
Were, on the quarry of these murther'd deer, 
To add the death of you. 
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak 
Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break. 
MACDUFF. And I must be from thence! 
MALCOLM. Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief 
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. 
MACDUFF. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes 
Come, go we to the King; our power is ready, 
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above

As surfeit is the father of much fast, 
So every scope by the immoderate use 
certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief 
have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment. 
You know the lady; she is fast my wife, 
Save that we do the denunciation lack 
Remaining in the coffer of her friends. 
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment, 
And the new deputy now for the Duke- 
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, 
Or whether that the body public be 
A horse whereon the governor doth ride, 
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know 
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur; 
Whether the tyranny be in his place, 
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties 
Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by th' wall 
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act 
Send after the Duke, and appeal to him. 
This day my sister should the cloister enter, 
Acquaint her with the danger of my state; 
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.

which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the 
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love 
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends 
How I have ever lov'd the life removed, 
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear, 
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds, 
Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch, 
For terror, not to use, in time the rod 
And liberty plucks justice by the nose; 
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart 
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope, 
And not the punishment. Therefore, indeed, my father, 
I have on Angelo impos'd the office; 
Who may, in th' ambush of my name, strike home, 
And yet my nature never in the fight 
Supply me with the habit, and instruct me 
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare. 
Turn you the key, and know his business of him: 
But in the presence of the prioress; 
As bring me to the sight of Isabella, 
A novice of this place, and the fair sister

With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,

The Duke is very strangely gone from hence; 
By those that know the very nerves of state, 
The wanton stings and motions of the sense, 
With profits of the mind, study and fast.

And follows close the rigour of the statute 
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer 
Already, and, as I hear, the Provost hath

Where is the Duke? 'Tis he should hear me speak. 
ESCALUS. The Duke's in us; and we will hear you speak; 
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox, 
Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone? 
Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust 
And put your trial in the villain's mouth 
LUCIO. This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. 
And in the witness of his proper ear, 
To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice? 
Take him hence; to th' rack with him! We'll touze you 
DUKE. Be not so hot; the Duke 
Till it o'errun the stew: laws for all faults, 
But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes 
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, 
ESCALUS. Slander to th' state! Away with him to prison! 
Is this the man that you did tell us of? 
DUKE. I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at 
the prison, in the absence of the Duke. 
LUCIO. O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke? 
LUCIO. Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and 
LUCIO. O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the nose for 
DUKE. I protest I love the Duke as I love myself. 
ANGELO. Hark how the villain would close now, after his treasonable 
prison! Where is the Provost? Away with him to prison! Lay bolts 
too, and with the other confederate companion! 
[The PROVOST lays bands on the DUKE] 
[Pulls off the FRIAR'S bood and discovers the DUKE] 
DUKE. Thou art the first knave that e'er mad'st a duke. 
[To Lucio] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you 
Is all the grace I beg. 
Do you the office, friar; which consummate, 
Than at the strangeness of it. 
It was the swift celerity of his death, 
The very mercy of the law cries out 
We do condemn thee to the very block 
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour, 
And, for the most, become much more the better 
In that he did the thing for which he died; 
That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects; 
DUKE. Had you a special warrant for the deed? 
For testimony whereof, one in the prison, 
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood 
LUCIO. Faith, my lord, I spoke it but according to the trick. 
Proclaim it, Provost, round about the city, 
And he shall marry her. The nuptial finish'd, 
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's: 
Th' offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,

The several caskets to this noble Prince. 
PRINCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription bears: 
The second, silver, which this promise carries: 
How shall I know if I do choose the right? 
PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, Prince; 
I will survey th' inscriptions back again. 
What says the silver with her virgin hue? 
May not extend so far as to the lady; 
As much as I deserve? Why, that's the lady! 
Why, that's the lady! All the world desires her; 
From the four corners of the earth they come 
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds 
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head 
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar 
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come 
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave. 
A coin that bears the figure of an angel 
Lies all within. Deliver me the key; 
Then I am yours. [He opens the golden casket] 
There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.

But there the Duke was given to understand 
Besides, Antonio certified the Duke

She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.'

And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,

Of the right casket, never in my life 
What says the golden chest? Ha! let me see: 
By the fool multitude, that choose by show, 
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach; 
Which pries not to th' interior, but, like the martlet, 
Builds in the weather on the outward wall, 
Even in the force and road of casualty. 
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. 
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume 
Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer! 
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour

And you shall see 'tis purchas'd by the weight, 
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind 
To be the dowry of a second head- 
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre. 
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore 
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf

To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold, 
And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!

To the last hour of act; and then, 'tis thought,

Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture, 
Forgive a moiety of the principal, 
To have the due and forfeit of my bond.

SHYLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

You may as well go stand upon the beach 
And bid the main flood bate his usual height; 
You may as well use question with the wolf, 
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb; 
You may as well forbid the mountain pines 
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven; 
Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will. 
'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you: 
The pound of flesh which I demand of him 
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness 
Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit 
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, 
SHYLOCK. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, 
Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

of your letter I am very sick; but in the instant that your

DUKE OF VENICE. YOU hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes; 
And here, I take it, is the doctor come. 
Are you acquainted with the difference 
That holds this present question in the court? 
PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause. 
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew? 
PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow; 
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law 
PORTIA. Do you confess the bond? 
PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful. 
PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain'd; 
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven 
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: 
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes 
The throned monarch better than his crown; 
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, 
The attribute to awe and majesty, 
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; 
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 
That in the course of justice none of us 
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much 
To mitigate the justice of thy plea, 
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. 
SHYLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, 
The penalty and forfeit of my bond. 
BASSANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court; 
Yea, twice the sum; if that will not suffice, 
Wrest once the law to your authority; 
And many an error, by the same example, 
Will rush into the state; it cannot be. 
PORTIA. I pray you, let me look upon the bond. 
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim 
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful. 
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond. 
SHYLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour. 
You know the law; your exposition 
Hath been most sound; I charge you by the law, 
There is no power in the tongue of man 
ANTONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court 
To give the judgment. 
PORTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law 
Hath full relation to the penalty, 
Which here appeareth due upon the bond. 
So says the bond; doth it not, noble judge? 
'Nearest his heart,' those are the very words. 
The flesh? 
SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond? 
SHYLOCK. I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond. 
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, 
Tell her the process of Antonio's end; 
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge 
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, 
But life itself, my wife, and all the world, 
If she were by to hear you make the offer. 
The wish would make else an unquiet house. 
SHYLOCK. [Aside] These be the Christian husbands! I have a 
Would any of the stock of Barrabas 
The court awards it and the law doth give it. 
The law allows it and the court awards it. 
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh.' 
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed 
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate 
Unto the state of Venice. 
SHYLOCK. Is that the law? 
PORTIA. Thyself shalt see the act; 
SHYLOCK. I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice, 
And let the Christian go. 
BASSANIO. Here is the money. 
The Jew shall have all justice. Soft! No haste. 
He shall have nothing but the penalty. 
PORTIA. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh. 
As makes it light or heavy in the substance, 
Or the division of the twentieth part 
Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn 
But in the estimation of a hair- 
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip. 
PORTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture. 
PORTIA. He hath refus'd it in the open court; 
PORTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture 
SHYLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it! 
The law hath yet another hold on you. 
It is enacted in the laws of Venice, 
He seek the life of any citizen, 
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive 
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half 
Comes to the privy coffer of the state; 
And the offender's life lies in the mercy 
Of the Duke only, 'gainst all other voice. 
Thou hast contrived against the very life 
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd 
The danger formerly by me rehears'd. 
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke. 
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, 
Thou hast not left the value of a cord; 
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge. 
DUKE OF VENICE. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, 
The other half comes to the general state, 
PORTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio. 
You take my house when you do take the prop 
When you do take the means whereby I live. 
ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court 
To quit the fine for one half of his goods; 
The other half in use, to render it 
Upon his death unto the gentleman 
The other, that he do record a gift, 
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd 
The pardon that I late pronounced here. 
I am not well; send the deed after me 
To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font. 
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew, 
BASSANIO.. There's more depends on this than on the value. 
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, 
ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring. 
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst, 
And in the morning early will we both 
PORTIA. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed, 
That they did give the rings away to men; 
Belmont. The garden before PORTIA'S house 
LORENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this, 
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees, 
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls, 
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents, 
Did Thisby fearfully o'ertrip the dew, 
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself, 
Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love 
Medea gathered the enchanted herbs 
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew, 
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man. 
LORENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night? 
My mistress will before the break of day 
Some welcome for the mistress of the house. 
Within the house, your mistress is at hand; 
And bring your music forth into the air. Exit STEPHANO 
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! 
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music 
Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night 
Become the touches of sweet harmony. 
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven 
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st 
Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins; 
LORENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive; 
Which is the hot condition of their blood- 
By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet 
But music for the time doth change his nature. 
The man that hath no music in himself, 
The motions of his spirit are dull:as night, 
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music. 
NERISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle. 
PORTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less: 
Into the main of waters. Music! hark! 
NERISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house. 
PORTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark 
No better a musician than the wren. 
Peace, ho! The moon sleeps with Endymion, 
LORENZO. That is the voice, 
PORTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, 
By the bad voice. 
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words. 
PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick; 
Such as the day is when the sun is hid. 
BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, 
If you would walk in absence of the sun. 
This is the man, this is Antonio, 
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk. 
PORTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter? 
For all the world like cutler's poetry 
NERISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value? 
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it. 
No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk; 
Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth 
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano, 
And swear I lost the ring defending it. 
Unto the judge that begg'd it, and indeed 
Deserv'd it too; and then the boy, his clerk, 
But the two rings. 
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone. 
Until I see the ring. 
If you did know to whom I gave the ring, 
If you did know for whom I gave the ring, 
And would conceive for what I gave the ring, 
And how unwillingly I left the ring, 
When nought would be accepted but the ring, 
You would abate the strength of your displeasure. 
PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, 
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, 
Or your own honour to contain the ring, 
You would not then have parted with the ring. 
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty 
To urge the thing held as a ceremony? 
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring. 
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him, 
Even he that had held up the very life 
For by these blessed candles of the night, 
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor. 
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, 
For, if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen. 
ANTONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels. 
And in the hearing of these many friends 
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord 
And bid him keep it better than the other. 
BASSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor! 
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me. 
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk, 
GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways 
In summer, where the ways are fair enough. 
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, 
BASSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not? 
GRATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold? 
NERISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, 
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift, 
LORENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way 
GRATIANO. Let it be so. The first inter'gatory 
Whether till the next night she had rather stay, 
But were the day come, I should wish it dark, 
Till I were couching with the doctor's clerk.

And I serve the Fairy Queen, 
To dew her orbs upon the green. 
The cowslips tall her pensioners be; 
PUCK. The King doth keep his revels here to-night; 
Take heed the Queen come not within his sight; 
And jealous Oberon would have the child 
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild; 
But she perforce withholds the loved boy, 
That frights the maidens of the villagery, 
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern, 
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn, 
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm, 
I am that merry wanderer of the night. 
And on her withered dewlap pour the ale. 
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale, 
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh, 
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,

TITANIA. These are the forgeries of jealousy; 
And never, since the middle summer's spring, 
Or in the beached margent of the sea, 
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, 
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, 
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea 
Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land, 
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain, 
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn 
The fold stands empty in the drowned field, 
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock; 
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud, 
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green, 
The human mortals want their winter here; 
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, 
Pale in her anger, washes all the air, 
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts 
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose; 
Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer, 
The childing autumn, angry winter, change 
Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world, 
The fairy land buys not the child of me. 
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night, 
Marking th' embarked traders on the flood; 
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive, 
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind; 
Would imitate, and sail upon the land, 
That the rude sea grew civil at her song, 
To hear the sea-maid's music. 
Flying between the cold moon and the earth 
At a fair vestal, throned by the west, 
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon; 
And the imperial vot'ress passed on, 
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell. 
Fetch me that flow'r, the herb I showed thee once. 
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid 
Upon the next live creature that it sees. 
Ere the leviathan can swim a league. 
PUCK. I'll put a girdle round about the earth 
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes; 
The next thing then she waking looks upon, 
She shall pursue it with the soul of love. 
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me. 
HELENA. And even for that do I love you the more. 
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you. 
DEMETRIUS. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit; 
To leave the city and commit yourself 
Into the hands of one that loves you not; 
To trust the opportunity of night, 
And the ill counsel of a desert place, 
With the rich worth of your virginity. 
Therefore I think I am not in the night; 
For you, in my respect, are all the world. 
When all the world is here to look on me? 
DEMETRIUS. I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, 
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts. 
HELENA. The wildest hath not such a heart as you. 
Run when you will; the story shall be chang'd: 
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase; 
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind 
Makes speed to catch the tiger- bootless speed, 
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood. 
HELENA. Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, 
To die upon the hand I love so well. Exit HELENA 
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer. 
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, 
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, 
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, 
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, 
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, 
But do it when the next thing he espies 
May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man 
By the Athenian garments he hath on. 
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.

And tarry for the comfort of the day.

Love takes the meaning in love's conference. 
HERMIA. With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd! 
PUCK. Through the forest have I gone, 
Despised the Athenian maid; 
And here the maiden, sleeping sound, 
On the dank and dirty ground. 
All the power this charm doth owe: 
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace. 
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground! 
The tedious minutes I with her have spent. 
The will of man is by his reason sway'd, 
And reason says you are the worthier maid. 
And touching now the point of human skill, 
Reason becomes the marshal to my will, 
For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things 
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings, 
Or as the heresies that men do leave 
Of all be hated, but the most of me!

Though I alone do feel the injury. 
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up; 
Why then, you left me- O, the gods forbid!- 
HERMIA. 'Puppet!' why so? Ay, that way goes the game. 
Did not you tell me I should know the man 
By the Athenian garments he had on? 
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night; 
The starry welkin cover thou anon 
To take from thence all error with his might 
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend 
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast; 
I with the Morning's love have oft made sport; 
And, like a forester, the groves may tread 
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red, 
To plainer ground. Exit LYSANDER as following the voice 
PUCK. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars, 
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars, 
The villain is much lighter heel'd than I. 
And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face. 
Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east, 
Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers, 
Here will I rest me till the break of day.

Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man, 
That never set a squadron in the field, 
Nor the division of a battle knows 
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, 
Wherein the toged consuls can propose 
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election; 
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof 
And I- God bless the mark!- his Moorship's ancient. 
IAGO. Why, there's no remedy. 'Tis the curse of service, 
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself 
To love the Moor.

IAGO. I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the 
Moor are now making the beast with two backs. 
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night, 
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor- 
That, from the sense of all civility, 
Let loose on me the justice of the state 
BRABANTIO. Strike on the tinder, ho! 
Against the Moor; for I do know, the state, 
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, 
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search, 
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father! 
BRABANTIO. O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! 
By which the property of youth and maidhood 
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor? 
IAGO. Though in the trade of war I have slain men, 
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience 
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs. 
That, with the little godliness I have, 
That the magnifico is much beloved, 
As double as the Duke's. He will divorce you, 
The law, with all his might to enforce it on, 
My services, which I have done the signiory, 
But that I love the gentle Desdemona, 
For the sea's worth. But, look! What lights come yond? 
IAGO. Those are the raised father and his friends. 
OTHELLO. The servants of the Duke? And my lieutenant? 
The goodness of the night upon you, friends! 
What is the news? 
CASSIO. The Duke does greet you, general, 
Even on the instant. 
OTHELLO. What is the matter, think you? 
It is a business of some heat. The galleys 
And many of the consuls, raised and met, 
Are at the Duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for, 
The Senate hath sent about three several quests 
I will but spend a word here in the house 
RODERIGO. Signior, it is the Moor. 
OTHELLO. Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. 
The wealthy, curled darlings of our nation, 
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom 
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense 
For an abuser of the world, a practicer 
Both you of my inclining and the rest. 
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied, 
Upon some present business of the state 
The Duke's in council, and your noble self, 
BRABANTIO. How? The Duke in council? 
In this time of the night? Bring him away; 
Mine's not an idle cause. The Duke himself, 
Or any of my brothers of the state, 
A council chamber. The Duke and Senators sitting at a table; 
As in these cases, where the aim reports,

And you of her, the bloody book of law 
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter 
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems, 
Your special mandate for the state affairs 
The very head and front of my offending 
And little blest with the soft phrase of peace; 
Their dearest action in the tented field, 
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, 
Send for the lady to the Sagittary, 
The trust, the office I do hold of you, 
OTHELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place. 
I do confess the vices of my blood, 
Still question'd me the story of my life 
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, 
To the very moment that he bade me tell it: 
Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach, 
Of being taken by the insolent foe 
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence 
It was my hint to speak- such was the process- 
And of the Cannibals that each other eat, 
The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads 
But still the house affairs would draw her thence, 
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd, 
This only is the witchcraft I have used. 
Here comes the lady; let her witness it. 
Take up this mangled matter at the best: 
If she confess that she was half the wooer, 
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress. 
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty, 
Due to the Moor, my lord. 
Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs; 
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended 
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. 
Is the next way to draw new mischief on. 
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; 
BRABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; 
He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears 
But the free comfort which from thence he hears; 
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow 
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear. 
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and 
voice on you. You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss

Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war

Even to the very quality of my lord. 
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,

To please the palate of my appetite, 
Nor to comply with heat- the young affects 
Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,

And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor 
Out of the way, that your converse and business 
The general and his wife are talking of it, 
And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies 
To take the safest occasion by the front 
A room in the castle. 
OTHELLO. These letters give, Iago, to the pilot, 
And by him do my duties to the Senate. 
That done, I will be walking on the works; 
The garden of the castle. 
As if the cause were his. 
To the last article. My lord shall never rest; 
OTHELLO. The sooner, sweet, for you. 
I meet the captains at the citadel. 
I prithee, name the time, but let it not 
Save that, they say, the wars must make example 
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more; 
They're close dilations, working from the heart, 
The worst of words. 
Is the immediate jewel of their souls. 
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock 
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss 
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend 
To follow still the changes of the moon 
When I shall turn the business of my soul 
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; 
And on the proof, there is no more but this- 
To show the love and duty that I bear you 
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks 
IAGO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you- 
Much will be seen in that. In the meantime, 
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind 
Into the vale of years- yet that's not much- 
And live upon the vapor of a dungeon, 
Than keep a corner in the thing I love 
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones: 
Prerogatived are they less than the base; 
Your dinner, and the generous islanders 
He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it. 
This was her first remembrance from the Moor. 
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token, 
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out, 
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, 
And, to the advantage, I being here took't up. 
Are to the jealous confirmations strong 
The Moor already changes with my poison: 
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, 
But with a little act upon the blood 
Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so. 
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, 
OTHELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack. 
I slept the next night well, was free and merry; 
OTHELLO. I had been happy if the general camp, 
Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content! 
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars 
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, 
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife, 
The royal banner, and all quality, 
The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit, 
Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof; 
Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul, 
OTHELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it, 
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop 
OTHELLO. By the world, 
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on? 
Which lead directly to the door of truth, 
IAGO. I do not like the office; 
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots, 
Cried, "Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!" 
It speaks against her with the other proofs. 
OTHELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! 
OTHELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea, 
To the Propontic and the Hellespont, 
In the due reverence of a sacred vow Kneels. 
The execution of his wit, hands, heart, 
And will upon the instant put thee to't: 
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant. 
Before the castle. 
CLOWN. I will catechize the world for him; that is, make questions 
CLOWN. To do this is within the compass of man's wit, and therefore 
I will attempt the doing it. Exit. 
DESDEMONA. Who, he? I think the sun where he was born 
OTHELLO. A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands; 
The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it, 
OTHELLO. 'Tis true; there's magic in the web of it. 
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world 
The sun to course two hundred compasses, 
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work; 
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk, 
And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful 
OTHELLO. Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out o' the way? 
OTHELLO. Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives. 
OTHELLO. The handkerchief! 
OTHELLO. The handkerchief! 
OTHELLO. The handkerchief! 
I am most unhappy in the loss of it. 
And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her. 
DESDEMONA. How now, good Cassio! What's the news with you? 
Whom I with all the office of my heart 
And stood within the blank of his displeasure 
IAGO. Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon, 
When it hath blown his ranks into the air 
And, like the devil, from his very arm 
As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia, 
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness, 
DESDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause! 
They are not ever jealous for the cause, 
More tedious than the dial eight score times? 
To the felt absence now I feel a cause. 
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth, 
I like the work well. Ere it be demanded-

As doth the raven o'er the infected house,

CASSIO. Rub him about the temples. 
The lethargy must have his quiet course. 
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock, 
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself 
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns, 
For I will make him tell the tale anew, 
That dotes on Cassio, as 'tis the strumpet's plague 
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes. 
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

Come from the Duke. And, see your wife is with him.

LODOVICO. The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you. 
OTHELLO. I kiss the instrument of their pleasures. 
Opens the letter, and reads. 
DESDEMONA. And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico? 
LODOVICO. He did not call; he's busy in the paper. 
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio. 
LODOVICO. May be the letter moved him; 
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, 
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, 
LODOVICO. Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate 
Call all in all sufficient? This the nature 
The shot of accident nor dart of chance 
That stroke would prove the worst! 
Or did the letters work upon his blood, 
A room in the castle. 
OTHELLO. Nor send you out o' the way? 
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse! 
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives 
Leave procreants alone and shut the door; 
But not the words. 
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves 
DESDEMONA. Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep? 
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? 
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips, 
A fixed figure for the time of scorn 
The fountain from the which my current runs, 
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence! 
OTHELLO. O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles, 
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born! 
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks; 
The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets, 
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth, 
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter, 
And keep the gate of hell! 
I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel. Exit. 
EMILIA. Good madam, what's the matter with my lord? 
The small'st opinion on my least misuse? 
IAGO. What's the matter, lady? 
IAGO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day! 
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave, 
To lash the rascals naked through the world 
Even from the east to the west! 
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without, 
And made you to suspect me with the Moor. 
It doth abhor me now I speak the word; 
To do the act that might the addition earn 
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me. 
The business of the state does him offense, 
The messengers of Venice stay the meat. 
IAGO. What in the contrary? 
than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope. I will indeed

IAGO. O, no; he goes into Mauritania, and takes away with him the 
accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of 
thence, which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and 
it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to 
Another room in the castle. 
OTHELLO. Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned 
EMILIA. I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed. 
"The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree, 
The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans, 
Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones-" 
EMILIA. It's the wind. 
DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? 
i' the dark. 
DESDEMONA. Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world? 
EMILIA. The world's a huge thing; it is a great price

IAGO. I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense, 
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, 
That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor 
Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit. 
OTHELLO. The voice of Cassio; Iago keeps his word. 
GRATIANO. 'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful. 
To come in to the cry without more help. 
IAGO. What's the matter?

I'll fetch the general's surgeon. [To Bianca.] For you, mistress, 
CASSIO. None in the world; nor do I know the man. 
IAGO. [To Bianca.] What, look you pale? O, bear him out o' the air. 
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye? 
EMILIA. 'Las, what's the matter? What's the matter, husband? 
IAGO. Cassio hath here been set on in the dark 
IAGO. This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia, 
Emilia, run you to the citadel, 
Will you go on? [Aside.] This is the night 
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning. 
OTHELLO. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul. 
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood, 
Put out the light, and then put out the light. 
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose, 
It must needs wither; I'll smell it on the tree. Kisses her. 
And love thee after. One more, and this the last; 
DESDEMONA. I will so. What's the matter? 
Send for the man, and ask him. 
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception 
I saw the handkerchief. 
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving? 
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good? 
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe 
Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw. 
Where art thou? Unlocks the door. 
What's the matter with thee now? 
OTHELLO. It is the very error of the moon; 
EMILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth. 
EMILIA. O, the more angel she, 
And you the blacker devil! 
An honest man he is, and hates the slime 
I say thy husband. Dost understand the word? 
Rot half a grain a day! He lies to the heart. 
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther! 
MONTANO. What is the matter? How now, general? 
GRATIANO. What is the matter? 
EMILIA. And your reports have set the murther on. 
OTHELLO. O! O! O! Falls on the bed. 
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent 
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame 
No, I will speak as liberal as the north; 
GRATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife. 
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor. 
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass, 
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan, 
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper- 
GRATIANO. What is the matter? 
Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day 
From the possession of this heavenly sight! 
LODOVICO. Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth. 
Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave, 
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo, 
And here another. The one of them imports 
The death of Cassio to be undertook 
But that, belike, Iago in the interim 
OTHELLO. O the pernicious caitiff! 
Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came 
Till that the nature of your fault be known 
To the Venetian state. Come, bring away. 
I have done the state some service, and they know't. 
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand, 
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away 
Albeit unused to the melting mood, 
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees 
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, 
I took by the throat the circumcised dog 
Falls on the bed, and dies. 
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea! 
Look on the tragic loading of this bed; 
This is thy work. The object poisons sight; 
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house, 
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor, 
Remains the censure of this hellish villain, 
The time, the place, the torture. O, enforce it! 
Myself will straight aboard, and to the state

Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal, 
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? 
If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice, 
The accuser and the accused freely speak. 
In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire. 
Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap, 
As well appeareth by the cause you come; 
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray? 
BOLINGBROKE. First-heaven be the record to my speech! 
In the devotion of a subject's love, 
Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince, 
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, 
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly. 
Once more, the more to aggravate the note, 
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war, 
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues, 
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this. 
First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me 
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps, 
Disclaiming here the kindred of the King; 
By that and all the rites of knighthood else 
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments 
Or here, or elsewhere to the furthest verge 
That all the treasons for these eighteen years 
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death, 
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth, 
And, by the glorious worth of my descent, 
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul. 
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest. 
The other part reserv'd I by consent, 
The honourable father to my foe, 
But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament 
This is my fault. As for the rest appeal'd, 
It issues from the rancour of a villain, 
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom. 
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son. 
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage. 
The one my duty owes; but my fair name, 
Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear, 
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood 
The purest treasure mortal times afford 
The slavish motive of recanting fear, 
The swelling difference of your settled hate; 
Justice design the victor's chivalry.

GAUNT. Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood 
To stir against the butchers of his life! 
Which made the fault that we cannot correct, 
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven; 
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth, 
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut; 
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt; 
Who was the model of thy father's life. 
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, 
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death. 
GAUNT. God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute, 
Hath caus'd his death; the which if wrongfully, 
GAUNT. To God, the widow's champion and defence. 
Or, if misfortune miss the first career, 
And throw the rider headlong in the lists, 
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.

Enter the LORD MARSHAL and the DUKE OF AUMERLE

Stays but the summons of the appelant's trumpet.

The trumpets sound, and the KING enters with his nobles, 
The cause of his arrival here in arms; 
To swear him in the justice of his cause. 
MARSHAL. In God's name and the King's, say who thou art, 
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me; 
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm, 
The trumpets sound. Enter BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford, 
Depose him in the justice of his cause. 
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists, 
Except the Marshal and such officers 
MARSHAL. The appellant in all duty greets your Highness, 
As confident as is the falcon's flight 
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet. 
O thou, the earthly author of my blood, 
And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt, 
Even in the lusty haviour of his son. 
Be swift like lightning in the execution, 
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque 
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years. 
Order the trial, Marshal, and begin. 
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right! 
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, 
And dares him to set forward to the fight. 
Attending but the signal to begin. 
Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down. 
Withdraw with us; and let the trumpets sound 
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council 
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect 
And for we think the eagle-winged pride 
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep; 
But tread the stranger paths of banishment. 
The sly slow hours shall not determinate 
The dateless limit of thy dear exile; 
The hopeless word of 'never to return' 
As to be cast forth in the common air, 
The language I have learnt these forty years, 
That knows no touch to tune the harmony. 
Swear by the duty that you owe to God, 
To keep the oath that we administer: 
By this time, had the King permitted us, 
One of our souls had wand'red in the air, 
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm; 
The clogging burden of a guilty soul.

And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue. 
Save back to England, an the world's my way. Exit

Hath from the number of his banish'd years 
End in a word: such is the breath of Kings. 
For ere the six years that he hath to spend 
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd. 
When the tongue's office should be prodigal 
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart. 
GAUNT. The sullen passage of thy weary steps 
The precious jewel of thy home return. 
I wander from the jewels that I love. 
To foreign passages; and in the end, 
GAUNT. All places that the eye of heaven visits 
Think not the King did banish thee, 
But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit 
And not the King exil'd thee; or suppose 
Suppose the singing birds musicians, 
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd, 
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more 
The man that mocks at it and sets it light. 
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus? 
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite 
O, no! the apprehension of the good 
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse. 
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.

But to the next high way, and there I left him.

Awak'd the sleeping rheum, and so by chance 
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft 
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have length'ned hours 
Observ'd his courtship to the common people; 
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles 
And had the tribute of his supple knee,

The revenue whereof shall furnish us

The setting sun, and music at the close, 
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, 
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond, 
The open ear of youth doth always listen; 
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity- 
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder; 
Against infection and the hand of war, 
This precious stone set in the silver sea, 
Which serves it in the office of a wall, 
Against the envy of less happier lands; 
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry 
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son; 
Dear for her reputation through the world, 
England, bound in with the triumphant sea, 
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege 
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life, 
YORK. The King is come; deal mildly with his youth, 
For young hot colts being rag'd do rage the more. 
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon 
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave, 
GAUNT. O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be. 
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure 
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land. 
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, 
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; 
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood 
That blood already, like the pelican, 
Join with the present sickness that I have; 
For both hast thou, and both become the grave. 
YORK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so! 
KING RICHARD. The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he; 
The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables, 
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke 
I am the last of noble Edward's sons, 
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours; 
But when he frown'd, it was against the French 
But bloody with the enemies of his kin. 
KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the matter? 
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford? 
Did not the one deserve to have an heir? 
Call in the letters patents that he hath 
YORK. I'll not be by the while. My liege, farewell. 
KING RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight; 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead. 
WILLOUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford? 
The King is not himself, but basely led 
That will the King severely prosecute 
ROSS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes; 
And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he find 
ROSS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm. 
WILLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man. 
But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke. 
Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm; 
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails, 
ROSS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer; 
And unavoided is the danger now 
For suffering so the causes of our wreck. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death 
How near the tidings of our comfort is. 
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter, 
All these, well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine, 
The first departing of the King for Ireland. 
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown, 
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt, 
You promis'd, when you parted with the King, 
QUEEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself 
More than with parting from my lord the King. 
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve; 
I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland. 
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself, 
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy, 
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby, 
And all the rest revolted faction traitors? 
GREEN. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester 
And all the household servants fled with him 
QUEEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe, 
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life, 
GREEN. Here comes the Duke of York. 
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth, 
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made; 
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold 
But I shall grieve you to report the rest. 
SERVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duchess died. 
The King had cut off my head with my brother's. 
And bring away the armour that is there. 
Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd, 
BUSHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland. 
Proportionable to the enemy 
GREEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love 
Is near the hate of those love not the King. 
BAGOT. And that is the wavering commons; for their love 
BUSHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd. 
Because we ever have been near the King. 
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there. 
Will the hateful commons perform for us, 
GREEN. Alas, poor Duke! the task he undertakes 
Making the hard way sweet and delectable. 
The tediousness and process of my travel. 
But theirs is sweet'ned with the hope to have 
The present benefit which I possess; 
Than hope enjoy'd. By this the weary lords 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Queen? 
PERCY. No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court, 
The household of the King. 
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford; 
What power the Duke of York had levied there; 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy? 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke. 
PERCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, 
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour- 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby, 
BOLINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor; 
From the most gracious regent of this land, 
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on 
To take advantage of the absent time, 
Com'st thou because the anointed King is hence? 
Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind, 
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men, 
From forth the ranks of many thousand French, 
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise the 
YORK. Even in condition of the worst degree- 
Before the expiration of thy time, 
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath been too much abused. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is 
But for his own; and for the right of that 
YORK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms. 
Unto the sovereign mercy of the King; 
Unless you please to enter in the castle, 
The caterpillars of the commonwealth, 
And yet we hear no tidings from the King; 
The King reposeth all his confidence in thee. 
CAPTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay. 
The bay trees in our country are all wither'd, 
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; 
The pale-fac'd moon looks bloody on the earth, 
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy, 
The other to enjoy by rage and war. 
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings. 
SALISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind, 
Fall to the base earth from the firmament! 
The sun sets weeping in the lowly west, 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
From off my hands, here in the view of men 
Broke the possession of a royal bed, 
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks 
Near to the King in blood, and near in love 
Eating the bitter bread of banishment, 
To show the world I am a gentleman. 
Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over 
To execution and the hand of death. 
BUSHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me 
And plague injustice with the pains of hell. 
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, and others, with the prisoners 
Uncle, you say the Queen is at your house; 
The coast of Wales. A castle in view 
Drums. Flourish and colours. Enter the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, 
AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air 
After your late tossing on the breaking seas? 
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet 
The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd 
The proffered means of succour and redress. 
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid, 
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world, 
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines 
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs, 
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night, 
Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes, 
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east, 
Not able to endure the sight of day, 
Not all the water in the rough rude sea 
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king; 
The breath of worldly men cannot depose 
The deputy elected by the Lord. 
Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right. 
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead, 
KING RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men 
Is not the King's name twenty thousand names? 
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground, 
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold. 
The worst is death, and death will have his day. 
To bear the tidings of calamity. 
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores, 
As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears, 
So high above his limits swells the rage 
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot? 
That they have let the dangerous enemy 
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate. 
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound 
And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground. 
AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead? 
AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power? 
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth. 
Save our deposed bodies to the ground? 
And that small model of the barren earth 
For God's sake let us sit upon the ground 
And tell sad stories of the death of kings: 
Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd, 
All murder'd-for within the hollow crown 
That rounds the mortal temples of a king 
Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits, 
Comes at the last, and with a little pin 
But presently prevent the ways to wail. 
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength, 
SCROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky 
The state in inclination of the day; 
I play the torturer, by small and small 
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken: 
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow, 
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue. 
The Welshmen are dispers'd; and Salisbury 
Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and good, my lord. 
YORK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland 
To say 'King Richard.' Alack the heavy day 
YORK. The time hath been, 
For taking so the head, your whole head's length. 
Lest you mistake. The heavens are over our heads. 
PIERCY. The castle royally is mann'd, my lord, 
Within the limits of yon lime and stone; 
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, 
NORTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle. 
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle; 
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley 
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power 
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood 
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen; 
The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke 
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land, 
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain. 
[NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet] 
Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum, 
With no less terror than the elements 
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven. 
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water; 
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain 
My waters-on the earth, and not on him. 
Enter on the walls, the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, 
As doth the blushing discontented sun 
From out the fiery portal of the east, 
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent 
To dim his glory and to stain the track 
Of his bright passage to the occident. 
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth 
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee, 
If we be not, show us the hand of God 
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre, 
And threat the glory of my precious crown. 
The purple testament of bleeding war; 
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace, 
Shall ill become the flower of England's face, 
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King 
And by the honourable tomb he swears 
And by the royalties of both your bloods, 
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt, 
And by the worth and honour of himself, 
KING RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns: 
And all the number of his fair demands 
With all the gracious utterance thou hast 
Defiance to the traitor, and so die? 
That laid the sentence of dread banishment 
KING RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit? 
The King shall do it. Must he be depos'd? 
The King shall be contented. Must he lose 
The name of king? A God's name, let it go. 
Or I'll be buried in the king's high way, 
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn 
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes 
Within the earth; and, therein laid-there lies 
NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, in the base court he doth attend 
Wanting the manage of unruly jades. 
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base, 
In the base court? Come down? Down, court! down, king! 
Enter the KING, and his attendants, below 
To make the base earth proud with kissing it. 
That know the strong'st and surest way to get. 
The DUKE OF YORK's garden 
Enter the QUEEN and two LADIES 
To drive away the heavy thought of care? 
QUEEN. 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs 
And that my fortune runs against the bias. 
It doth remember me the more of sorrow; 
But stay, here come the gardeners. 
Let's step into the shadow of these trees. 
Give some supportance to the bending twigs. 
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays 
The noisome weeds which without profit suck 
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers. 
SERVANT. Why should we, in the compass of a pale, 
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land, 
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf; 
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter, 
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green. 
Hath seiz'd the wasteful King. O, what pity is it 
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees, 
Had he done so, himself had home the crown, 
SERVANT. What, think you the King shall be deposed? 
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's 
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested the 
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold 
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke, 
Besides himself, are all the English peers, 
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke? 
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow! 
In the remembrance of a weeping queen. Exeunt 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Enter, as to the Parliament, BOLINGBROKE, AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, PERCY, 
FITZWATER, SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, 
Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd 
The bloody office of his timeless end. 
BAGOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle. 
That reacheth from the restful English Court 
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns 
With the attainder of his slanderous lips. 
There is my gage, the manual seal of death 
To stain the temper of my knightly sword. 
AUMERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best 
To prove it on thee to the extremest point 
Over the glittering helmet of my foe! 
ANOTHER LORD. I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle; 
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest. 
The very time Aumerle and you did talk. 
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do he 
Engage it to the trial, if thou dar'st. 
Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say 
To execute the noble Duke at Calais. 
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross 
BOLINGBROKE. Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom 
YORK. Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to the 
To the possession of thy royal hand. 
BOLINGBROKE. In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne. 
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth. 
And shall the figure of God's majesty, 
The blood of English shall manure the ground, 
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls. 
It will the woefullest division prove 
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit? 
bearing the regalia 
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts 
The favours of these men. Were they not mine? 
God save the King! Will no man say amen? 
God save the King! although I be not he; 
The resignation of thy state and crown 
KING RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown. 
The emptier ever dancing in the air, 
The other down, unseen, and full of water. 
The cares I give I have, though given away; 
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay. 
BOLINGBROKE. Are you contented to resign the crown? 
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart; 
Against the state and profit of this land; 
That, by confessing them, the souls of men 
Containing the deposing of a king 
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath, 
Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven. 
I find myself a traitor with the rest; 
T'undeck the pompous body of a king; 
No, not that name was given me at the font- 
But 'tis usurp'd. Alack the heavy day, 
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The Commons will not, then, be satisfied. 
When I do see the very book indeed 
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face 
Did keep ten thousand men? Was this the face 
That like the sun did make beholders wink? 
Is this the face which fac'd so many follies 
As brittle as the glory is the face; 
[Dashes the glass against the ground] 
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport- 
BOLINGBROKE. The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd 
The shadow of your face. 
The shadow of my sorrow? Ha! let's see. 
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief 
That swells with silence in the tortur'd soul. 
There lies the substance; and I thank thee, king, 
Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way 
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon, 
BOLINGBROKE. Go, some of you convey him to the Tower. 
Exeunt all but the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, the 
CARLISLE. The woe's to come; the children yet unborn 
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot? 
You shall not only take the sacrament

London. A street leading to the Tower 
Enter the QUEEN, with her attendants 
QUEEN. This way the King will come; this is the way 
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand; 
From which awak'd, the truth of what we are 
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw 
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage 
Take the correction mildly, kiss the rod, 
Which art a lion and the king of beasts? 
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire 
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me, 
And send the hearers weeping to their beds; 
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize 
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue, 
And in compassion weep the fire out; 
For the deposing of a rightful king. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd; 
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower. 
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne, 
The time shall not be many hours of age 
Though he divide the realm and give thee half 
And he shall think that thou, which knowest the way 
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne. 
The love of wicked men converts to fear; 
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me; 
Part us, Northumberland; I towards the north, 
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime; 
QUEEN. Banish us both, and send the King with me. 
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near. 
QUEEN. So longest way shall have the longest moans. 
KING RICHARD. Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short, 
And piece the way out with a heavy heart. 
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say. Exeunt 
The DUKE OF YORK's palace 
Enter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUCHESS 
DUCHESS. My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest, 
When weeping made you break the story off, 
YORK. Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke, 
You would have thought the very windows spake, 
Upon his visage; and that all the walls 
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning, 
DUCHESS. Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst? 
YORK. As in a theatre the eyes of men 
After a well-grac'd actor leaves the stage 
The badges of his grief and patience, 
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted, 
And lasting fealty to the new-made king. 
DUCHESS. Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now 
That strew the green lap of the new come spring? 
Yea, look'st thou pale? Let me see the writing. 
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing. 
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph-day. 
Boy, let me see the writing. 
DUCHESS. What is the matter, my lord? 
I will appeach the villain. 
DUCHESS. What is the matter? 
DUCHESS. I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle? 
YORK. Bring me my boots. I will unto the King. 
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own? 
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament, 
To kill the King at Oxford. 
Spur post, and get before him to the King, 
And never will I rise up from the ground 
Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there, 
Takes on the point of honour to support 
PERCY. My lord, some two days since I saw the Prince, 
BOLINGBROKE. And what said the gallant? 
PERCY. His answer was, he would unto the stews, 
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove 
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger. 
AUMERLE. Where is the King? 
What is the matter with our cousin now? 
AUMERLE. For ever may my knees grow to the earth, 
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be, 
AUMERLE. Then give me leave that I may turn the key, 
[The DUKE OF YORK knocks at the door and crieth] 
YORK. [Within] Open the door, secure, foolhardy King. 
Open the door, or I will break it open. 
BOLINGBROKE. What is the matter, uncle? Speak; 
The treason that my haste forbids me show. 
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, King; 
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart. 
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death. 
Speak with me, pity me, open the door. 
And now chang'd to 'The Beggar and the King.' 
This fest'red joint cut off, the rest rest sound; 
This let alone will all the rest confound. 
And never see day that the happy sees 
Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow. 
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech. 
The word is short, but not so short as sweet; 
That sets the word itself against the word! 
The chopping French we do not understand. 
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand. 
BOLINGBROKE. But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Abbot, 
With all the rest of that consorted crew, 
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels. 
EXTON. Didst thou not mark the King, what words he spake? 
As who should say 'I would thou wert the man 
Meaning the King at Pomfret. Come, let's go. 
I am the King's friend, and will rid his foe. Exeunt 
Pomfret Castle. The dungeon of the Castle 
This prison where I live unto the world 
And, for because the world is populous 
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul, 
My soul the father; and these two beget 
In humours like the people of this world, 
For no thought is contented. The better sort, 
With scruples, and do set the word itself 
Against the word, 
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.' 
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs 
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves, 
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars 
Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame, 
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back 
Of such as have before endur'd the like. 
With being nothing. [The music plays] 
So is it in the music of men's lives. 
And here have I the daintiness of ear 
But, for the concord of my state and time, 
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, 
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is 
Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans, 
While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock. 
Enter a GROOM of the stable 
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear. 
GROOM. So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground. 
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck 
Who lately came from the King, commands the contrary. 
KING RICHARD. The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee! 
[Beats the KEEPER] 
The murderers, EXTON and servants, rush in, armed 
Hath with the King's blood stain'd the King's own land. 
Both have I spill'd. O, would the deed were good! 
For now the devil, that told me I did well, 
This dead King to the living King I'll bear. 
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here. Exeunt 
Flourish. Enter BOLINGBROKE, the DUKE OF YORK, With other LORDS 
BOLINGBROKE. Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear 
Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire 
Welcome, my lord. What is the news? 
The next news is, I have to London sent 
The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent. 
The manner of their taking may appear 
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely; 
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors 
Enter PERCY, With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE 
PERCY. The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster, 
Hath yielded up his body to the grave; 
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies, 
I hate the murderer, love him murdered. 
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour, 
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,

To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,

Have no delight to pass away the time, 
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun 
And hate the idle pleasures of these days. 
To set my brother Clarence and the King

That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower. 
But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know? 
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G, 
'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower; 
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower, 
But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds 
That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore. 
If we will keep in favour with the King, 
The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself, 
We speak no treason, man; we say the King 
And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.

But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings? 
Well are you welcome to the open air. 
That were the cause of my imprisonment.

I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes. 
O, cursed be the hand that made these holes! 
Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it! 
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence! 
That makes us wretched by the death of thee 
May fright the hopeful mother at the view, 
More miserable by the death of him 
[The bearers take up the coffin] 
GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down. 
GLOUCESTER. Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul, 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the coffin 
[The bearers set down the coffin] 
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil. 
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell 
Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead; 
ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth! 
The which thou once didst bend against her breast, 
But that thy brothers beat aside the point. 
GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath 
ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest! 
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths 
As blameful as the executioner? 
ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect. 
GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect- 
To undertake the death of all the world 
As all the world is cheered by the sun, 
ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth. 
GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature. 
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made 
Told the sad story of my father's death, 
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks 
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale 
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, 
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke, 
And humbly beg the death upon my knee. 
[She falls the sword] 
Take up the sword again, or take up me. 
Speak it again, and even with the word 
ANNE. To take is not to give. [Puts on the ring] 
GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse. 
The bleeding witness of my hatred by; 
But the plain devil and dissembling looks, 
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing! 
Fram'd in the prodigality of nature, 
The spacious world cannot again afford; 
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince

QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all 
GREY. The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son 
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester, 
But so it must be, if the King miscarry. 
GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Countess Richmond, good my Lord 
The envious slanders of her false accusers; 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of 
DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I 
Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers, 
I fear our happiness is at the height. 
Who is it that complains unto the King 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the 
The King, on his own royal disposition 
Makes him to send that he may learn the ground. 
GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad 
Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility 
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been 
GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean 
GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with telling of the 
I will avouch't in presence of the King. 
I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r. 
Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower, 
Were factious for the house of Lancaster; 
GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward's party for the crown; 
Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof! 
That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof. 
QUEEN MARGARET. As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof; 
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine. 
GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee, 
And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout 
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland- 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent. 
HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe, 
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of! 
Ready to catch each other by the throat, 
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? 
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace! 
The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul! 
The slave of nature and the son of hell, 
O, let me make the period to my curse! 
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me 
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top, 
And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun. 
QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas! 
Witness my son, now in the shade of death, 
Nor thou within the compass of my curse. 
The lips of those that breathe them in the air. 
QUEEN MARGARET. I will not think but they ascend the sky 
His venom tooth will rankle to the death: 
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from? 
Live each of you the subjects to his hate, 
GLOUCESTER. Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong. 
God pardon them that are the cause thereof! 
GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. 
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach 
I lay unto the grievous charge of others. 
And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies 
That stir the King against the Duke my brother. 
And seem a saint when most I play the devil. 
FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the 
[Gives the warrant] 
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution, 
London. The Tower 
So full of dismal terror was the time! 
CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower 
Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England, 
During the wars of York and Lancaster, 
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, 
Into the tumbling billows of the main. 
All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea; 
Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes 
That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep 
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by. 
KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death 
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep? 
To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood 
To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air; 
Who almost burst to belch it in the sea. 
O, then began the tempest to my soul! 
I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood 
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. 
The first that there did greet my stranger soul 
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury. 
Such hideous cries that, with the very noise, 
Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant 
Makes the night morning and the noontide night. 
There's nothing differs but the outward fame. 
Enter the two MURDERERS 
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands. 
Because I will be guiltless from the meaning. 
There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys. 
I'll to the King and signify to him 
SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great 
SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath 
be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can 
FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and 
FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's 
SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward. 
SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse! 
persuading me not to kill the Duke. 
SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe 
him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the 
FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of 
thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the 
FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks 
CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, 
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it. 
FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King. 
To slay the innocent? What is my offence? 
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me? 
Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd 
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death? 
The deed you undertake is damnable. 
CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings 
Hath in the tables of his law commanded 
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight 
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster. 
FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God 
Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son. 
If God will be avenged for the deed, 
Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm; 
CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage. 
From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven. 
To do this deed will hate you for the deed. 
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within. 
Exit with the body 
By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have 
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say; 
For I repent me that the Duke is slain. Exit 
Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole, 
Till that the Duke give order for his burial;

BUCKINGHAM. [To the QUEEN] Whenever Buckingham 
To make the blessed period of this peace. 
Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke. 
KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day. 
More than the infant that is born to-night. 
Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead? 
BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest? 
DORSET. Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence 
KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd. 
Some tardy cripple bare the countermand 
DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life; 
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk. 
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake 
The mighty Warwick and did fight for me? 
Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury 
Who told me, when we both lay in the field 
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night? 
The precious image of our dear Redeemer, 
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all 
GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not 
How that the guilty kindred of the Queen 
O, they did urge it still unto the King! 
London. The palace 
Enter the old DUCHESS OF YORK, with the SON and DAUGHTER of CLARENCE 
I do lament the sickness of the King, 
The King mine uncle is to blame for it. 
DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you 
Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen, 
Why grow the branches when the root is gone? 
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap? 
That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's, 
And hast the comfort of thy children left; 
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon, 
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! 
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs! 
For it requires the royal debt it lent you. 
Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him; 
To wail the dimming of our shining star; 
That is the butt end of a mother's blessing; 
We are to reap the harvest of his son. 
The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts, 
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet 
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out, 
Which would be so much the more dangerous 
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd; 
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent, 
GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us; 
And the compact is firm and true in me. 
That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince. 
BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince, 
For by the way I'll sort occasion, 
As index to the story we late talk'd of, 
To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince. 
Enter one CITIZEN at one door, and another at the other 
Hear you the news abroad? 
FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead. 
SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the 
THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's 
SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while! 
FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth 
THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, 
With politic grave counsel; then the King 
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester! 
And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud; 
FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be 
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night? 
SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear. 
THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so; 
The water swell before a boist'rous storm. 
SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices. 
London. The palace 
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young DUKE OF YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH, 
and the DUCHESS OF YORK 
DUCHESS. I long with all my heart to see the Prince. 
DUCHESS. Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold 
In him that did object the same to thee. 
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young, 
ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince? 
MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham. 
MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd. 
Why or for what the nobles were committed 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house! 
The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind; 
Upon the innocent and aweless throne. 
I see, as in a map, the end of all. 
My husband lost his life to get the crown; 
Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors

The trumpets sound. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES, GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, 
The weary way hath made you melancholy. 
PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way 
GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your 
Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit; 
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. 
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts. 
GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet 
Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train 
Would long ere this have met us on the way. 
BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating 
The Queen your mother and your brother York 
Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince 
Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York 
Can from his mother win the Duke of York, 
We should infringe the holy privilege 
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, 
The benefit thereof is always granted 
To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place 
And those who have the wit to claim the place. 
Then, taking him from thence that is not there, 
PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may. 
Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower, 
PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place. 
Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age, 
Even to the general all-ending day. 
[Aside] Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity, 
Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL 
BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of 
The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far. 
YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it! 
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle 
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you. 
YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord? 
YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower. 
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower. 
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe. 
Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way. 
For the instalment of this noble Duke 
In the seat royal of this famous isle? 
CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince 
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower, 
To sit about the coronation. 
Be thou so too, and so break off the talk, 
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more. 
CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can. 
The earldom of Hereford and all the movables 
Whereof the King my brother was possess'd. 
Enter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS 
MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley. 
MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four. 
He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm. 
And that may be determin'd at the one 
Which may make you and him to rue at th' other. 
And with all speed post with him toward the north 
To shun the danger that his soul divines. 
Bid him not fear the separated council: 
His honour and myself are at the one, 
And at the other is my good friend Catesby; 
To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers. 
To fly the boar before the boar pursues 
Were to incense the boar to follow us 
And we will both together to the Tower, 
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly. 
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm. 
HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the 
Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd. 
Upon his party for the gain thereof; 
The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret. 
God knows I will not do it to the death. 
CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you- 
[Aside] For they account his head upon the bridge. 
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided? 
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood, 
STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from 
But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast. 
What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent. 
To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded. 
How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee? 
PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask. 
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower 
By the suggestion of the Queen's allies; 
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you. 
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest: 
The men you talk of came into my mind. 
What, go you toward the Tower? 
I shall return before your lordship thence. 
Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying the Nobles, 
GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you! 
RATCLIFF. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out. 
Within the guilty closure of thy walls 
RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death; 
RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate. 
London. The Tower 
Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP of ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, 
HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met 
Is to determine of the coronation. 
In God's name speak-when is the royal day? 
BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for the royal time? 
BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind 
Who is most inward with the noble Duke? 
But for his purpose in the coronation 
But you, my honourable lords, may name the time; 
And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice, 
BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself. 
I mean, your voice for crowning of the King. 
And finds the testy gentleman so hot 
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne. 
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd. 
Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY 
BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester? 
HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord, 
To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be. 
GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil. 
I will not dine until I see the same. 
The rest that love me, rise and follow me. 
STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms, 
And started when he look'd upon the Tower, 
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house. 
O, now I need the priest that spake to me! 
I now repent I told the pursuivant, 
RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at 
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! 
Into the fatal bowels of the deep. 
I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee 
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head. 
London. The Tower-walls 
BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian; 
GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along. 
Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY 
GLOUCESTER. Look to the drawbridge there! 
GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlook the walls. 
BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent- 
LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, 
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings. 
GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep. 
I took him for the plainest harmless creature 
That breath'd upon the earth a Christian; 
The history of all her secret thoughts. 
BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red 
We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor 
This day had plotted, in the council-house, 
Or that we would, against the form of law, 
Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death 
But that the extreme peril of the case, 
The peace of England and our persons' safety, 
To warn false traitors from the like attempts. 
Which now the loving haste of these our friends, 
The traitor speak, and timorously confess 
The manner and the purpose of his treasons: 
That you might well have signified the same 
Unto the citizens, who haply may 
T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world. 
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post. 
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time, 
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children. 
Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house, 
Which by the sign thereof was termed so. 
And, by true computation of the time, 
Found that the issue was not his begot; 
Being nothing like the noble Duke my father. 
BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator 
As if the golden fee for which I plead 
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords. Exit 
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, 
Have any time recourse unto the Princes. Exit 
SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings; 
And mark how well the sequel hangs together: 
The precedent was full as long a-doing; 
Here's a good world the while! Who is so gros 
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought, 
GLOUCESTER. How now, how now! What say the citizens? 
BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord, 
The citizens are mum, say not a word. 
GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's 
Th' insatiate greediness of his desire, 
And his enforcement of the city wives; 
And his resemblance, being not like the Duke. 
Being the right idea of your father, 
And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence. 
His answer was, the people were not used 
To be spoke to but by the Recorder. 
'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'- 
At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps, 
And thus I took the vantage of those few- 
Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come? 
BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear; 
Play the maid's part: still answer nay, and take it. 
BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor 
Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens 
I think the Duke will not be spoke withal. 
BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke; 
Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen, 
Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof; 
Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence, 
To stay him from the fall of vanity; 
And pardon us the interruption 
Who, earnest in the service of my God, 
Deferr'd the visitation of my friends. 
That seems disgracious in the city's eye, 
The supreme seat, the throne majestical, 
The scept'red office of your ancestors, 
The lineal glory of your royal house, 
To the corruption of a blemish'd stock; 
Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, 
The noble isle doth want her proper limbs; 
And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf 
Your gracious self to take on you the charge 
For this, consorted with the citizens, 
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, 
Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends. 
Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first, 
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last- 
And that my path were even to the crown, 
As the ripe revenue and due of birth, 
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd. 
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit 
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time, 
Will well become the seat of majesty 
The right and fortune of his happy stars, 
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, 
To Bona, sister to the King of France. 
Even in the afternoon of her best days, 
Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree 
This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince. 
If not to bless us and the land withal, 
From the corruption of abusing times 
Loath to depose the child, your brother's son; 
But we will plant some other in the throne 
To the disgrace and downfall of your house; 
If you deny them, all the land will rue it. 
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest 
I must have patience to endure the load; 
Attend the sequel of your imposition, 
From all the impure blots and stains thereof; 
How far I am from the desire of this. 
GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth. 
GLOUCESTER. [To the BISHOPS] Come, let us to our holy

And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.

No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels. 
How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news? 
The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled 
To Richmond, in the parts where he abides. [Stands apart] 
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.

TYRREL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge 
TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them; 
But where, to say the truth, I do not know. 
When thou shalt tell the process of their death. 
KING RICHARD. The son of Clarence have I pent up close; 
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom, 
Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims 
And by that knot looks proudly on the crown, 
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen, 
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth. 
We must be brief when traitors brave the field. Exeunt 
London. Before the palace 
And drop into the rotten mouth of death. 
To watch the waning of mine enemies. 
And will to France, hoping the consequence 
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK 
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air 
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf? 
Give mine the benefit of seniory, 
And let my griefs frown on the upper hand. 
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept 
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth 
Preys on the issue of his mother's body 
The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; 
Match'd not the high perfection of my loss. 
And the beholders of this frantic play, 
Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, 
That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.' 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would 
The presentation of but what I was, 
The flattering index of a direful pageant, 
To be the aim of every dangerous shot, 
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene. 
Who sues, and kneels, and says 'God save the Queen'? 
Where be the bending peers that flattered thee? 
Where be the thronging troops that followed thee? 
For joyful mother, one that wails the name; 
Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about 
To torture thee the more, being what thou art. 
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? 
And leave the burden of it all on thee. 
QUEEN MARGARET. Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the 
Bett'ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse; 
Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart. 
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother 
The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims. 
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done! 
The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown, 
And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers? 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, 
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women 
Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say! 
Or with the clamorous report of war 
That cannot brook the accent of reproof. 
DUCHESS. No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well 
Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell. 
Strike up the drum. 
Which in the day of battle tire thee more 
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st! 
My prayers on the adverse party fight; 
And there the little souls of Edward's children 
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. I have no moe sons of the royal blood 
Throw over her the veil of infamy; 
KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny. 
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt 
To revel in the entrails of my lambs. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. What good is cover'd with the face of 
KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of Fortune, 
The high imperial type of this earth's glory. 
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul 
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the process of thy 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her 
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body, 
KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way 
If I did take the kingdom from your sons, 
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb, 
Than is the doating title of a mother; 
The loss you have is but a son being King, 
The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife, 
And all the ruins of distressful times 
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed 
Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame 
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes 
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.

That God, the law, my honour, and her love 
KING RICHARD. Tell her the King, that may command, 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King's 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. To wail the title, as her mother doth. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third 
KING RICHARD. Now, by the world- 
The unity the King my husband made 
Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head, 
Had grac'd the tender temples of my child; 
And both the Princes had been breathing here, 
Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms. 
KING RICHARD. The time to come. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time 
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd, 
The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed, 
Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul, 
Be the attorney of my love to her; 
Urge the necessity and state of times, 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus? 
KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good. 
KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed. 
RATCLIFF. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast 
And there they hull, expecting but the aid 
KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of 
KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke. 
Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke? 
The greatest strength and power that he can make

When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way? 
STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas. 
KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him! 
He makes for England here to claim the crown. 
KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd? 
Is the King dead, the empire unpossess'd? 
Then tell me what makes he upon the seas. 
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes. 
Are they not now upon the western shore, 
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships? 
STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north. 
KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the 
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?

Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.

Reward to him that brings the traitor in? 
The Britaine navy is dispers'd by tempest. 
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks

That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond 
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.

Do through the clouds behold this present hour, 
This is the day which in King Edward's time 
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall 
By the false faith of him whom most I trusted; 
Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs;

Let us survey the vantage of the ground. 
Enter, on the other side of the field,

I'll draw the form and model of our battle,

And by the second hour in the morning 
Desire the Earl to see me in my tent. 
South from the mighty power of the King. 
In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold.

Into the blind cave of eternal night. Exit CATESBY 
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow. 
KING RICHARD. Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord 
RATCLIFF. Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself, 
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers. 
RATCLIFF, about the mid of night come to my tent 
RICHMOND. All comfort that the dark night can afford 
So much for that. The silent hours steal on, 
And flaky darkness breaks within the east. 
In brief, for so the season bids us be, 
Prepare thy battle early in the morning, 
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement 
With best advantage will deceive the time 
Farewell; the leisure and the fearful time 
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love 
The usurping helmets of our adversaries! 
That we may praise Thee in the victory! 
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.

And slaughtered those that were the means to help him; 
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil 
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain; 
Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire; 
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors; 
If you do free your children from the sword, 
Then, in the name of God and all these rights, 
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt 
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;

The least of you shall share his part thereof. 
KING RICHARD. He said the truth; and what said Surrey 
RATCLIFF. He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.' 
KING He was in the right; and so indeed it is. 
Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar. 
Who saw the sun to-day? 
KING RICHARD. Then he disdains to shine; for by the book 
He should have brav'd the east an hour ago. 
KING RICHARD. The sun will not be seen to-day; 
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army. 
I would these dewy tears were from the ground. 
More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven 
NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field. 
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, 
Our archers shall be placed in the midst. 
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse. 
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side 
A thing devised by the enemy. 
Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe. 
They would restrain the one, distain the other. 
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again; 
And, in record, left them the heirs of shame. 
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head! 
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves! 
NORFOLK. My lord, the enemy is pass'd the marsh. 
After the battle let George Stanley die. 
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons! 
Another part of the field 
The King enacts more wonders than a man, 
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death. 
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost. 
And I Will stand the hazard of the die. 
I think there be six Richmonds in the field; 
Another part of the field 
Retreat and flourish. Enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the crown, 
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead. 
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch 
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled 
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament, 
We will unite the white rose and the red. 
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood, 
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son, 
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire; 
The true succeeders of each royal house, 
Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace, 
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,

From forth the fatal loins of these two foes 
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,

Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house of Capulet. 
Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me. 
Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the 
Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the 
Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are 
ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men 
from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall. 
Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men. 
with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off 
Greg. The heads of the maids? 
Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads. 
poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of 
Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. 
Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay? 
Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword, 
Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word 
Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues! 
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage 
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground 
And hear the sentence of your moved prince. 
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets 
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. 
For this time all the rest depart away. 
Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary 
I drew to part them. In the instant came 
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd; 
He swung about his head and cut the winds, 
Till the Prince came, who parted either part. 
Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun 
Peer'd forth the golden window of the East, 
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore 
That westward rooteth from the city's side, 
And stole into the covert of the wood. 
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, 
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun 
Should in the farthest East bean to draw 
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, 
Unless good counsel may the cause remove. 
Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? 
As is the bud bit with an envious worm 
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air 
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. 
Rom. Is the day so young? 
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; 
She will not stay the siege of loving terms, 
Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes, 
Rom. 'Tis the way 
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair. 
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. 
Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown. 
For men so old as we to keep the peace. 
My child is yet a stranger in the world, 
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years; 
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; 
She is the hopeful lady of my earth. 
Such as I love; and you among the store, 
When well apparell'd April on the heel 
that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor 
with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with

here writ. I must to the learned. In good time! 
And the rank poison of the old will die. 
Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language. 
The lady widow of Vitruvio; 
Lucio and the lively Helena.' 
[Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they come? 
Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich 
Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come 
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st; 
With all the admired beauties of Verona. 
Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye 
One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun 
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. 
Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile, 
Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, 
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; 
Of all the days of the year, upon that day; 
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall. 
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple 
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! 
Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow, 
For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood, 
For even the day before, she broke her brow;

The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.' 
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd. 
Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme

As all the world- why he's a man of wax. 
Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?

Find written in the margent of his eyes, 
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride 
For fair without the fair within to hide. 
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory, 
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; 
Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd, my 
young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and 
Juliet, the County stays. 
Ben. The date is out of such prolixity. 
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper; 
After the prompter, for our entrance; 
Being but heavy, I will bear the light. 
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. 
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. 
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; 
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done. 
Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word! 
If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire 
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! 
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes 
On the forefinger of an alderman, 
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; 
Her traces, of the smallest spider's web; 
Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams; 
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film; 
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; 
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, 
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. 
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, 
That plats the manes of horses in the night 
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs, 
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, 
Which are the children of an idle brain, 
Which is as thin of substance as the air, 
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes 
Even now the frozen bosom of the North 
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, 
Turning his face to the dew-dropping South. 
Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, 
With this night's revels and expire the term 
But he that hath the steerage of my course 
They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]

thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.

Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day 
More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up, 
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. 
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, 
Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand 
Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! 
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave 
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, 
I would not for the wealth of all this town 
It is my will; the which if thou respect, 
Am I the master here, or you? Go to! 
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. 
Jul. You kiss by th' book. 
Her mother is the lady of the house. 
Shall have the chinks. 
Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.

A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard. 
[Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.] 
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; 
When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid! 
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. 
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, 
To be consorted with the humorous night. 
Blind is his love and best befits the dark. 
Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. 
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! 
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, 
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, 
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars 
Would through the airy region stream so bright 
Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes

And sails upon the bosom of the air. 
Had I it written, I would tear the word. 
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.

And the place death, considering who thou art,

As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,

So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. 
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

Which is the god of my idolatry, 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be

And yet I wish but for the thing I have. 
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, 
My love as deep; the more I give to thee, 
The more I have, for both are infinite. 
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; 
And follow thee my lord throughout the world. 
Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! 
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, 
Rom. By the hour of nine. 
Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night, 
Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light; 
Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye 
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, 
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb. 
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies 
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live 
But to the earth some special good doth give; 
Within the infant rind of this small flower 
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. 
And where the worser is predominant, 
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. 
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill

Is this the poultice for my aching bones? 
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks: 
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love 
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight; 
But you shall bear the burthen soon at night. 
Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell. 
Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act 
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy 
Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey 
And in the taste confounds the appetite. 
Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot 
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint. 
A lover may bestride the gossamer 
That idles in the wanton summer air,

For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

Mer. The fee simple? O simple! 
Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets. 
Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.

Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee 
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage

villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil 
Rom. I thought all for the best. 
Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally, 
That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds, 
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. 
This but begins the woe others must end. 
Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. 
Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again 
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. 
Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death 
I charge thee in the Prince's name obey. 
Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray? 
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. 
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, 
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd 
How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal 
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen 
Cold death aside and with the other sends 
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life 
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. 
Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague; 
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? 
His fault concludes but what the law should end, 
The life of Tybalt. 
That you shall all repent the loss of mine. 
As Phaeton would whip you to the West 
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night 
And he will make the face of heaven so fine 
That all the world will be in love with night 
And pay no worship to the garish sun. 
O, I have bought the mansion of a love, 
As is the night before some festival 
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords 
Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords. 
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead! 
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice. 
Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes, 
(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast. 
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight. 
Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! 
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! 
Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did! 
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend 
Sole monarch of the universal earth. 
Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom 
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom. 
Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom? 
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. 
Hence banished is banish'd from the world, 
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. 
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince, 
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, 
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand 
O friar, the damned use that word in hell; 
Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart, 
And fall upon the ground, as I do now, 
Taking the measure of an unmade grave. 
Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans, 
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. Knock. 
Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. 
Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all. 
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy 
Shot from the deadly level of a gun, 
The hateful mansion. [Draws his dagger.] 
The unreasonable fury of a beast. 
Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? 
Digressing from the valour of a man; 
Misshapen in the conduct of them both, 
The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend 
But look thou stay not till the watch be set, 
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back 
And bid her hasten all the house to bed, 
Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night 
Either be gone before the watch be set, 
Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence. 
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window. 
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, 
That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear. 
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. 
Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn; 
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East. 
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. 
It is some meteor that the sun exhales 
And light thee on the way to Mantua. 
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, 
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; 
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat 
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads. 
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, 
Some say the lark makes sweet division; 
Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes; 
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day! 
The day is broke; be wary, look about. 
I must hear from thee every day in the hour, 
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. 
Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend 
Jul. Feeling so the loss, 
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. 
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him. 
Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives. 
Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. 
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt 
Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. 
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, 
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, 
Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, 
But for the sunset of my brother's son 
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, 
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is 
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs, 
I would the fool were married to her grave! 
Or never after look me in the face. 
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, 
Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds 
That sees into the bottom of my grief? 
Or if you do not, make the bridal bed 
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing 
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, 
I think it best you married with the County. 
I'll to the friar to know his remedy. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short. 
Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind. 
Uneven is the course; I like it not. 
To stop the inundation of her tears, 
Now do you know the reason of this haste. 
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. 
Jul. The tears have got small victory by that, 
My lord, we must entreat the time alone. 
Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so, 
It strains me past the compass of my wits. 
Shall be the label to another deed, 
Shall play the empire, arbitrating that 
Which the commission of thy years and art 
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, 
From off the battlements of yonder tower, 
Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. 
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade 
Like death when he shuts up the day of life; 
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes 
Then, as the manner of our country is, 
In thy best robes uncovered on the bier 
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. 
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, 
Abate thy valour in the acting it. 
Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin 
Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this. 
Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell 
Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty. 
This is as't should be. Let me see the County. 
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho! 
To move the heavens to smile upon my state, 
And let the nurse this night sit up with you; 
That almost freezes up the heat of life. 
What if it be a poison which the friar 
How if, when I am laid into the tomb, 
I wake before the time that Romeo 
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, 
The horrible conceit of death and night, 
Together with the terror of the place- 
Where for this many hundred years the bones 
At some hours in the night spirits resort- 
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, 
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud., 
She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains. 
Enter Lady of the House and Nurse. 
Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry. 
Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd, 
The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock. 
Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica; 
Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what. 
And never trouble Peter for the matter. 
The County will be here with music straight, 
Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already: 
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, 
The County Paris hath set up his rest 
Ay, let the County take you in your bed! 
[Draws aside the curtains.] 
Mother. What is the matter? 
Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day! 
Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead! 
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. 
Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians. 
Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church? 
O son, the night before thy wedding day 
And all the better is it for the maid. 
The most you sought was her promotion, 
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? 
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, 
And all things change them to the contrary. 
The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill; 
1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. 
Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the 
1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.

Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep 
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. 
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? 
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do. 
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? 
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! 
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; 
As I remember, this should be the house. 
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary! 
As will disperse itself through all the veins 
That the life-weary taker mall fall dead, 
And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath 
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb. 
The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law; 
The world affords no law to make thee rich; 
And drink it off, and if you had the strength 
Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John. 
Here in this city visiting the sick, 
And finding him, the searchers of the town, 
Where the infectious pestilence did reign, 
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth, 
The letter was not nice, but full of charge, 
Of dear import; and the neglecting it 
Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone. 
Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets. 
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground. 
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread 
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [Retires.] 
The obsequies that I for thee will keep 
The boy gives warning something doth approach. 
Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. 
Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning 
Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee, 
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger 
The time and my intents are savage-wild, 
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. 
Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth, 
Romeo opens the tomb. 
It is supposed the fair creature died- 
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. 
Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. 
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [Dies.] 
[Lays him in the tomb.] 
How oft when men are at the point of death 
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, 
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps 
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars 
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss 
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark! 
It burneth in the Capels' monument. 
Friar. Go with me to the vault. 
The stony entrance of this sepulchre? 
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.] 
Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs. 
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. 
Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. 
Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. 
[Exeunt some of the Watch.] 
Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain; 
Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets; 
Raise up the Montagues; some others search. 
[Exeunt others of the Watch.] 
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, 
But the true ground of all these piteous woes 
Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar]. 
2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard. 
Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. 
Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too. 
Enter the Prince [and Attendants]. 
Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,' 
Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; 
Is empty on the back of Montague, 
Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, 
Bring forth the parties of suspicion. 
Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least, 
Yet most suspected, as the time and place 
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city; 
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo 
Being the time the potion's force should cease. 
At the prefixed hour of her waking 
But when I came, some minute ere the time 
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. 
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, 
All this I know, and to the marriage 
Unto the rigour of severest law. 
And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault, 
Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it. 
Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch? 
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; 
And then I ran away to call the watch. 
Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words, 
Their course of love, the tidings of her death; 
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.

A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep, 
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.

Before I have a husband for the elder.

For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

I found the effect of love in idleness; 
As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was- 
Affection is not rated from the heart; 
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound. 
TRANIO. Master, you look'd so longly on the maid. 
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all. 
Such as the daughter of Agenor had, 
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand. 
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din? 
And with her breath she did perfume the air; 
I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid, 
That, till the father rid his hands of her,

To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage! 
He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage, 
Make friends invited, and proclaim the banns; 
Now must the world point at poor Katherine, 
rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt, 
with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with 
the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped 
with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fives, 
stark spoil'd with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, sway'd in 
the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg'd before, and with a 
BIONDELLO. O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison'd like 
the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose 
on the other, gart'red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and 
the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather; a 
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church. 
And seal the title with a lovely kiss! 
BAPTISTA. I'll after him and see the event of this. 
Which once perform'd, let all the world say no, 
I'll keep mine own despite of all the world. 
We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio, 
The narrow-prying father, Minola, 
The quaint musician, amorous Licio- 
Signior Gremio, came you from the church? 
TRANIO. And is the bride and bridegroom coming home? 
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find. 
TRANIO. Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam. 
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest 
That, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book; 
TRANIO. What said the wench, when he rose again? 
As if the vicar meant to cozen him. 
After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel, 
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face, 
This done, he took the bride about the neck, 
That at the parting all the church did echo. 
And I, seeing this, came thence for very shame; 
And after me, I know, the rout is coming. 
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play. [Music plays] 
GRUMIO. Ay, sir, they be ready; the oats have eaten the horses. 
The door is open, sir; there lies your way; 
That take it on you at the first so roundly. 
KATHERINA. Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner. 
Obey the bride, you that attend on her; 
Go to the feast, revel and domineer, 
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he 
TRANIO. Of all mad matches, never was the like. 
For to supply the places at the table, 
You know there wants no junkets at the feast. 
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place;

CURTIS. I prithee, good Grumio, tell me how goes the world? 
CURTIS. There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news? 
Where's the cook? Is supper ready, the house trimm'd, rushes 
strew'd, cobwebs swept, the serving-men in their new fustian, 
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without, the carpets

Where is the foolish knave I sent before? 
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park 
And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' th' heel; 
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly; 
Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN 
[Sings] Where is the life that late I led? 
[Sings] It was the friar of orders grey, 
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other. 
PETRUCHIO. 'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat. 
What dogs are these? Where is the rascal cook? 
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser 
[Throws the meat, etc., at them] 
The meat was well, if you were so contented. 
NATHANIEL. Peter, didst ever see the like? 
As with the meat, some undeserved fault 
I'll find about the making of the bed; 
And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster, 
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets; 
And with the clamour keep her still awake. 
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching. 
LUCENTIO. I read that I profess, 'The Art to Love.' 
Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio. 
As one unworthy all the former favours 
TRANIO. And here I take the like unfeigned oath, 
HORTENSIO. Would all the world but he had quite forsworn! 
TRANIO. Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school. 
BIANCA. The taming-school! What, is there such a place? 
TRANIO. Ay, mistress; and Petruchio is the master, 
An ancient angel coming down the hill 
Will serve the turn. 
As if he were the right Vincentio. 
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest? 
PEDANT. Sir, at the farthest for a week or two; 
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause? 
Your ships are stay'd at Venice; and the Duke, 
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes 
Till you have done your business in the city. 
The patron of my life and liberty. 
TRANIO. Then go with me to make the matter good. 
This, by the way, I let you understand: 
KATHERINA. The more my wrong, the more his spite appears. 
GRUMIO. Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little. 
KATHERINA. Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest. 
GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard, 
GRUMIO. Why then the mustard without the beef. 
That feed'st me with the very name of meat. 
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you 
PETRUCHIO. The poorest service is repaid with thanks; 
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat. 
And revel it as bravely as the best, 
What, hast thou din'd? The tailor stays thy leisure, 
Lay forth the gown. 
HABERDASHER. Here is the cap your worship did bespeak. 
KATHERINA. I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time, 
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart, 
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words. 
KATHERINA. Love me or love me not, I like the cap; 
According to the fashion and the time. 
I did not bid you mar it to the time.

PETRUCHIO. Ay, there's the villainy. 
GRUMIO. Error i' th' bill, sir; error i' th' bill! I commanded the 
GRUMIO. I am for thee straight; take thou the bill, give me thy 
PETRUCHIO. Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me. 
GRUMIO. You are i' th' right, sir; 'tis for my mistress. 
GRUMIO. O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for. 
PETRUCHIO. [Aside] Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.- 
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich; 
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, 
So honour peereth in the meanest habit. 
What, is the jay more precious than the lark 
Or is the adder better than the eel 
Because his painted skin contents the eye? 
O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse 
HORTENSIO. Why, so this gallant will command the sun. 
Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO, and the PEDANT dressed like VINCENTIO 
TRANIO. Sir, this is the house; please it you that I call? 
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus. 
Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio. 
[To To the PEDANT] Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of; 
And- for the good report I hear of you, 
And for the love he beareth to your daughter, 
The match is made, and all is done- 
We'll pass the business privately and well. 
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently. 
The worst is this, that at so slender warning

Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon! 
KATHERINA. The moon? The sun! It is not moonlight now. 
PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon that shines so bright. 
KATHERINA. I know it is the sun that shines so bright. 
PETRUCHIO. I say it is the moon. 
KATHERINA. I know it is the moon. 
PETRUCHIO. Nay, then you lie; it is the blessed sun. 
KATHERINA. Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun; 
And the moon changes even as your mind. 
HORTENSIO. Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won. 
PETRUCHIO. Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run, 
And not unluckily against the bias. 
HORTENSIO. 'A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

Happier the man whom favourable stars

I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

What foul play had we that we came from thence? 
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence; 
To think o' th' teen that I have turn'd you to, 
Of all the world I lov'd, and to him put 
The manage of my state; as at that time 
Through all the signories it was the first, 
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed 
In dignity, and for the liberal arts

Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key 
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' th' state

And executing th' outward face of royalty

The dukedom, yet unbow'd-alas, poor Milan!-

PROSPERO. Now the condition: 
Which was, that he, in lieu o' th' premises, 
Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan 
With all the honours on my brother. Whereon, 
Fated to th' purpose, did Antonio open 
The gates of Milan; and, i' th' dead of darkness, 
The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence 
And then I'll bring thee to the present busines 
Which now's upon 's; without the which this story 
So dear the love my people bore me; nor set 
A mark so bloody on the business; but 
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats

To th' winds, whose pity, sighing back again, 
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, 
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. 
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride 
On the curl'd clouds. To thy strong bidding task 
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee? 
I boarded the King's ship; now on the beak, 
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, 
And burn in many places; on the topmast, 
The yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, 
Then meet and join Jove's lightning, the precursors 
O' th' dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary 
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks 
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune 
But felt a fever of the mad, and play'd 
Plung'd in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel, 
Then all afire with me; the King's son, Ferdinand, 
Was the first man that leapt; cried 'Hell is empty, 
And all the devils are here.'

The mariners all under hatches stowed, 
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' th' fleet, 
And are upon the Mediterranean flote 
Supposing that they saw the King's ship wreck'd,

Hast strangely stood the test; here, afore heaven, 
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall 
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly 
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den, 
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion 
The edge of that day's celebration, 
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, 
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple 
Too much the rein; the strongest oaths are straw 
To th' fire i' th' blood. Be more abstemious, 
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart 
Abates the ardour of my liver. 
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves, 
Where thou thyself dost air-the Queen o' th' sky, 
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter; 
On the blest lovers.

Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son

ARIEL. On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord, 
When first I rais'd the tempest. Say, my spirit, 
How fares the King and 's followers? 
In the same fashion as you gave in charge; 
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell; 
They cannot budge till your release. The King, 
And the remainder mourning over them, 
Him you term'd, sir, 'the good old lord, Gonzalo'; 
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th' quick, 
Do I take part; the rarer action is 
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend 
And ye that on the sands with printless foot 
Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him 
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, 
Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime 
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid- 
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds, 
And 'twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault 
Set roaring war. To the dread rattling thunder 
With his own bolt; the strong-bas'd promontory 
Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck'd up 
The pine and cedar. Graves at my command 
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, 
and FRANCISCO. They all enter the circle which 
A solemn air, and the best comforter 
Mine eyes, ev'n sociable to the show of thine, 
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace, 
And as the morning steals upon the night, 
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses 
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle 
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. 
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide 
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore 
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell; Exit ARIEL 
Where the bee sucks, there suck I; 
On the bat's back I do fly 
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough. 
To the King's ship, invisible as thou art; 
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep 
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain 
ARIEL. I drink the air before me, and return 
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero. 
Th' affliction of my mind amends, with which, 
Some subtleties o' th' isle, that will not let you

How sharp the point of this remembrance is!- 
ALONSO. Irreparable is the loss; and patience 
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, 
ALONSO. You the like loss! 
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker 
The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish 
To be the lord on't. No more yet of this; 
I would not for the world. 
A vision of the island, one dear son 
FERDINAND. Though the seas threaten, they are merciful; 
ALONSO. Now all the blessings 
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us, 
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way 
Re-enter ARIEL, with the MASTER and BOATSWAIN 
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news? 
BOATSWAIN. The best news is that we have safely found 
Our King and company; the next, our ship- 
The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure, 
Untie the spell. [Exit ARIEL] How fares my gracious sir? 
STEPHANO. Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man 
PROSPERO. Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, 
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, 
PROSPERO. You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah? 
And the particular accidents gone by 
Since I came to this isle. And in the morn 
Where I have hope to see the nuptial 
And thence retire me to my Milan, where 
To hear the story of your life, which must 
Take the ear strangely. 
That is thy charge. Then to the elements 
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell 
With the help of your good hands.

Thy mistress is o' th' brothel. Son of sixteen, 
Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire, 
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth, 
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth, 
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive

Th' unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.

The Athenians both within and out that wall! 
To the whole race of mankind, high and low! 
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods, 
One friend to take his fortune by the arm 
A dedicated beggar to the air, 
And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck, 
Hearing the surges threat. We must all part

Enter TIMON in the woods 
TIMON. O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth 
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb- 
The greater scorns the lesser. Not nature, 
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary, 
The beggar native honour. 
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides, 
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares, 
Is smooth'd by that below. The learned pate 
Ducks to the golden fool. All's oblique; 
Will knit and break religions, bless th' accurs'd, 
Make the hoar leprosy ador'd, place thieves 
With senators on the bench. This is it 
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again- 
She whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores 
Would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices 
To th 'April day again. Come, damn'd earth, 
Among the rout of nations, I will make thee 
TIMON. A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart 
For showing me again the eyes of man! 
With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules.

Make use of thy salt hours. Season the slaves

In the sick air; let not thy sword skip one. 
He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron: 
Herself's a bawd. Let not the virgin's cheek

Th' immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths;

And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice, 
Nor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen, 
That scolds against the quality of flesh 
And not believes himself. Down with the nose, 
Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away 
Smells from the general weal. Make curl'd-pate ruffians bald, 
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war 
The source of all erection. There's more gold. 
ALCIBIADES. Strike up the drum towards Athens. Farewell, Timon; 
Engenders the black toad and adder blue, 
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm, 
With all th' abhorred births below crisp heaven 
Hath to the marbled mansion all above 
By putting on the cunning of a carper. 
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain, 
That have outliv'd the eagle, page thy heels 
And skip when thou point'st out? Will the cold brook, 
To cure thy o'ernight's surfeit? Call the creatures 
Whose naked natures live in all the spite 
To the conflicting elements expos'd, 
The one is filling still, never complete; 
The other, at high wish. Best state, contentless, 
Worse than the worst, content. 
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords 
To such as may the passive drugs of it 
The icy precepts of respect, but followed 
The sug'red game before thee. But myself, 
Who had the world as my confectionary; 
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men 
Do on the oak, have with one winter's brush 
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men, 
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee, 
That the whole life of Athens were in this! 
APEMANTUS. So I shall mend mine own by th' lack of thine. 
TIMON. The best and truest; 
APEMANTUS. The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the 
thou know'st none, but art despis'd for the contrary. There's a 
APEMANTUS. An th' hadst hated medlars sooner, thou shouldst have 
APEMANTUS. What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to 
TIMON. Women nearest; but men, men are the things themselves. What 
wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in thy 
APEMANTUS. Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men. 
TIMON. Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men, and 
remain a beast with the beasts? 
TIMON. A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t' attain to! 
If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee; if thou wert 
the lamb, the fox would eat thee; if thou wert the fox, the lion 
would suspect thee, when, peradventure, thou wert accus'd by the 
ass. If thou wert the ass, thy dulness would torment thee; and 
still thou liv'dst but as a breakfast to the wolf. If thou wert 
the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou 
shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner. Wert thou the unicorn, 
pride and wrath would confound thee, and make thine own self the 
the horse; wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seiz'd by the 
leopard; wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to the lion, and 
the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life. All thy safety 
mightst have hit upon it here. The commonwealth of Athens is 
TIMON. How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the 
APEMANTUS. Yonder comes a poet and a painter. The plague of company

But even the mere necessities upon't.

gold and the falling-from of his friends drove him into this 
THIRD BANDIT. Let us make the assay upon him; if he care not for't, 
Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots; 
The oaks bear mast, the briars scarlet hips; 
The bounteous housewife Nature on each bush 
TIMON. Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes; 
Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' th' grape 
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth, 
And so scape hanging. Trust not the physician; 
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction 
Robs the vast sea; the moon's an arrant thief, 
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun; 
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves 
The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief, 
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power

What viler thing upon the earth than friends,

Ere thou relieve the beggar. Give to dogs

Rome and the neighbourhood 
Rome. Before the Capitol 
Flourish. Enter the TRIBUNES and SENATORS aloft; and then enter below 
at the other, with drums and trumpets 
Defend the justice of my cause with arms; 
I am his first born son that was the last 
That ware the imperial diadem of Rome; 
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome, 
Keep then this passage to the Capitol; 
The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate, 
Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS aloft, with the crown 
Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand 
In election for the Roman empery 
Lives not this day within the city walls. 
He by the Senate is accited home, 
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths, 
In coffins from the field; and at this day 
To the monument of that Andronici 
And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths. 
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome, 
And in the Capitol and Senate's right, 
SATURNINUS. How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts. 
And to my fortunes and the people's favour 
Exeunt the soldiers of BASSIANUS 
And to the love and favour of my country 
Commit myself, my person, and the cause. 
Exeunt the soldiers of SATURNINUS 
Open the gates and let me in. 
[Flourish. They go up into the Senate House] 
CAPTAIN. Romans, make way. The good Andronicus, 
Successful in the battles that he fights, 
And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome. 
and then TAMORA the Queen of Goths, with her three 
sons, ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, with AARON the 
the coffin and TITUS speaks 
Lo, as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught 
Returns with precious lading to the bay 
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend! 
Half of the number that King Priam had, 
Behold the poor remains, alive and dead! 
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx? 
[They open the tomb] 
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont, 
LUCIUS. Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths, 
That so the shadows be not unappeas'd, 
TITUS. I give him you- the noblest that survives, 
The eldest son of this distressed queen. 
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed, 
But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets 
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods? 
The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy 
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent 
May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths- 
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes. 
MUTIUS, the sons of ANDRONICUS, with their swords bloody 
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire, 
Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky. 
[Sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb] 
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart! 
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome! 
Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome, 
And name thee in election for the empire 
But not a sceptre to control the world. 
MARCUS. Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery. 
Rather than rob me of the people's hearts! 
LUCIUS. Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good 
The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves. 
TRIBUNES. To gratify the good Andronicus, 
The people will accept whom he admits. 
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse. 
The wide world's Emperor, do I consecrate 
Receive them then, the tribute that I owe, 
The least of these unspeakable deserts, 
SATURNINUS. [Aside] A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue 
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths. 
TITUS. Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard? 
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away. 
TITUS kills him. During the fray, exeunt SATURNINUS, 
Re-enter aloft the EMPEROR 
with TAMORA and her two Sons, and AARON the Moor 
Traitor, restore Lavinia to the Emperor. 
SATURNINUS. No, Titus, no; the Emperor needs her not, 
That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands. 
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome. 
That, like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs, 
Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome, 
And here I swear by all the Roman gods- 
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome, 
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths, 
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine, 
Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed 
[The BROTHER and the SONS kneel] 
TITUS. Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed. 
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax, 
The dismal'st day is this that e'er I saw, 
Well, bury him, and bury me the next. 
[They put MUTIUS in the tomb] 
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths 
Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell. 
Is she not, then, beholding to the man 
Flourish. Re-enter the EMPEROR, TAMORA 
and her two SONS, with the MOOR, at one door; 
at the other door, BASSIANUS and LAVINIA, with others 
But let the laws of Rome determine all; 
By all the duties that I owe to Rome, 
That, in the rescue of Lavinia, 
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge 
TAMORA. Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend 
Lest, then, the people, and patricians too, 
The cruel father and his traitorous sons, 
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.- 
Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart 
And must advise the Emperor for his good. 
My word and promise to the Emperor 
The Tribune and his nephews kneel for grace. 
I would not part a bachelor from the priest. 
Come, if the Emperor's court can feast two brides, 
To hunt the panther and the hart with me,

Rome. Before the palace 
As when the golden sun salutes the morn, 
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams, 
Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach 
And overlooks the highest-peering hills, 
'Tis not the difference of a year or two 
AARON. [Aside] Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the 
CHIRON. Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have, 
So near the Emperor's palace dare ye draw 
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge: 
The cause were known to them it most concerns; 
Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome. 
Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore, 
Young lords, beware; an should the Empress know 
This discord's ground, the music would not please. 
CHIRON. I care not, I, knew she and all the world: 
I love Lavinia more than all the world. 
What, man! more water glideth by the mill 
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is 
Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother, 
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose? 
CHIRON. Ay, so the turn were served. 
Must we pursue, and I have found the path. 
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop; 
The forest walks are wide and spacious, 
The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame, 
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears; 
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull. 
DEMETRIUS. Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream 
TITUS. The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey, 
The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green. 
And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride, 
And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter's peal, 
That all the court may echo with the noise. 
To attend the Emperor's person carefully. 
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase, 
And climb the highest promontory top. 
TITUS. And I have horse will follow where the game 
Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain. 
A lonely part of the forest 
[Hides the gold] 
That have their alms out of the Empress' chest. 
Enter TAMORA alone, to the Moor 
The birds chant melody on every bush; 
The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun; 
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind 
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground; 
And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds, 
Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns, 
The wand'ring prince and Dido once enjoyed, 
We may, each wreathed in the other's arms, 
Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul, 
This is the day of doom for Bassianus; 
And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll. 
To see the general hunting in this forest? 
Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had, 
With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds 
This valley fits the purpose passing well. 
BASSIANUS. The King my brother shall have notice of this. 
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean, 
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds, 
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven. 
They told me, here, at dead time of the night, 
Unto the body of a dismal yew, 
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms 
TAMORA. Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys, 
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw. 
TAMORA. But when ye have the honey we desire, 
LAVINIA. When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam? 
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble, 
LAVINIA. 'Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark. 
The lion, mov'd with pity, did endure 
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests; 
To save your brother from the sacrifice; 
The worse to her the better lov'd of me. 
The blot and enemy to our general name! 
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him. 
DEMETRIUS throws the body 
of BASSIANUS into the pit; then exeunt 
Till all the Andronici be made away. 
AARON. Come on, my lords, the better foot before; 
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit 
Where I espied the panther fast asleep. 
[Falls into the pit] 
Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall? 
MARTIUS. O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt 
AARON. [Aside] Now will I fetch the King to find them here, 
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise; 
Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks, 
And shows the ragged entrails of this pit; 
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus 
I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb 
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink. 
Enter the EMPEROR and AARON the Moor 
Into this gaping hollow of the earth? 
MARTIUS. The unhappy sons of old Andronicus, 
He and his lady both are at the lodge 
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase; 
TAMORA. Where is my lord the King? 
SATURNINUS. Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound; 
The complot of this timeless tragedy; 
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him. 
Among the nettles at the elder-tree 
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit 
O Tamora! was ever heard the like? 
This is the pit and this the elder-tree. 
Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out 
AARON. My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold. 
Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison; 
Accursed if the fault be prov'd in them- 
Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers; 
Let them not speak a word- the guilt is plain; 
TAMORA. Andronicus, I will entreat the King. 
Another part of the forest 
Enter the Empress' sons, DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, with LAVINIA, 
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe. 
DEMETRIUS. If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord. 
O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast, 
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is. 
O, had the monster seen those lily hands 
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, 
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony 
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet. 
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,

Enter the JUDGES, TRIBUNES, and SENATORS, with TITUS' two sons 
MARTIUS and QUINTUS bound, passing on the stage to the place of execution, 
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd, 
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks, 
[ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges 
pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt] 
For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write 
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite; 
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow 
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death, 
The Tribunes hear you not, no man is by, 
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones; 
Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes, 
For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd 
What fool hath added water to the sea, 
My grief was at the height before thou cam'st, 
Now all the service I require of them 
Is that the one will help to cut the other. 
MARCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park, 
Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer 
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave, 
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn 
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey dew 
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them. 
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes. 
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long, 
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness, 
Pass the remainder of our hateful days? 
Enter AARON the Moor 
AARON. Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor 
And send it to the King: he for the same 
And that shall be the ransom for their fault. 
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise? 
With all my heart I'll send the Emperor my hand. 
Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn, 
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe, 
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle? 
MARCUS. But I will use the axe. 
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it! 
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth; 
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim 
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds 
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow? 
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad, 
Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face? 
I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow. 
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth; 
For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor. 
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons; 
The closing up of our most wretched eyes. 
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head, 
And in this hand the other will I bear. 
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there; 
The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome. 
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen. 
Now will I to the Goths, and raise a pow'r 
Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA, and the boy YOUNG LUCIUS 
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall 
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears. 
Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands? 
To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er 
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands, 
If Marcus did not name the word of hands! 
MARCUS. Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd,

A deed of death done on the innocent 
And buzz lamenting doings in the air! 
Like to the Empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.

And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens 
Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed. 
Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was, 
Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest. 
TITUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her. 
This is the tragic tale of Philomel

Forc'd in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? 
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes, 
Unless the gods delight in tragedies?

That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed? 
Without the help of any hand at all. 
That we may know the traitors and the truth!

MARCUS. What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora 
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts, 
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims. 
And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope; 
And swear with me- as, with the woeful fere 
The dam will wake; and if she wind ye once,

And lay it by. The angry northern wind

Enter AARON, DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, at one door; and at the other door, 
CHIRON. Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius; 
BOY. My lords, with all the humbleness I may, 
[Aside] And pray the Roman gods confound you both! 
DEMETRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news? 
BOY. [Aside] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news, 
The goodliest weapons of his armoury 
The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say; 
I read it in the grammar long ago. 
Here's no sound jest! The old man hath found their guilt, 
That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick. 
It did me good before the palace gate 
To brave the Tribune in his brother's hearing. 
DEMETRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods 
AARON. [Aside] Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over. 
DEMETRIUS. Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus? 
CHIRON. Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son. 
O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor? 
AARON. Why, then she is the devil's dam; 
Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad 
Amongst the fair-fac'd breeders of our clime; 
The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal, 
Accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend! 
NURSE. Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so. 
DEMETRIUS. I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point. 
[Takes the CHILD from the NURSE, and draws] 
Now, by the burning tapers of the sky 
Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war, 
For all the water in the ocean 
Can never turn the swan's black legs to white, 
Although she lave them hourly in the flood. 
Tell the Empress from me I am of age 
The vigour and the picture of my youth. 
This before all the world do I prefer; 
This maugre all the world will I keep safe, 
NURSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death. 
AARON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears: 
The close enacts and counsels of thy heart! 
Look how the black slave smiles upon the father, 
Nay, he is your brother by the surer side, 
NURSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress? 
Save thou the child, so we may all be safe. 
My son and I will have the wind of you: 
I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor, 
The chafed boar, the mountain lioness, 
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms. 
But say, again, how many saw the child? 
NURSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself; 
And no one else but the delivered Empress. 
AARON. The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself. 
Two may keep counsel when the third's away: 
Go to the Empress, tell her this I said. [He kills her] 
So cries a pig prepared to the spit. 
Go pack with him, and give the mother gold, 
And tell them both the circumstance of all, 
And be received for the Emperor's heir 
And substituted in the place of mine, 
To calm this tempest whirling in the court; 
And let the Emperor dandle him for his own. 
[Pointing to the NURSE] 
The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms. 
But send the midwife presently to me. 
The midwife and the nurse well made away, 
Then let the ladies tattle what they please. 
CHIRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air 
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, bearing off the dead NURSE 
AARON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies, 
And secretly to greet the Empress' friends. 
And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat, 
Exit with the CHILD 
Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters on the ends of them; 
TITUS. Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way. 
Go sound the ocean and cast your nets; 
Happily you may catch her in the sea; 
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth; 
What time I threw the people's suffrages 
Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war 
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine. 
I'll dive into the burning lake below 
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels. 
No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size; 
But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back, 
We will solicit heaven, and move the gods

You were as good to shoot against the wind.

We will afflict the Emperor in his pride.

Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons 
Than prosecute the meanest or the best 
But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick, 
Then is all safe, the anchor in the port. 
TAMORA. Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor. 
[SATURNINUS reads the letter] 
Go drag the villain hither by the hair; 
The Goths have gathered head; and with a power 
Of high resolved men, bent to the spoil, 
SATURNINUS. Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths? 
These tidings nip me, and I hang the head 
'Tis he the common people love so much; 
SATURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius, 
Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it? 
The eagle suffers little birds to sing, 
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings 
Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome. 
I will enchant the old Andronicus 
When as the one is wounded with the bait, 
The other rotted with delicious feed. 
Say that the Emperor requests a parley 
Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting 
Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus. 
And temper him with all the art I have, 
To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
FIRST GOTH. Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus, 
Led by their master to the flow'red fields, 
ALL THE GOTHS. And as he saith, so say we all with him. 
Upon the wasted building, suddenly 
I made unto the noise, when soon I heard 
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse: 
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white, 
Peace, villain, peace!'- even thus he rates the babe- 
Who, when he knows thou art the Empress' babe, 
To use as you think needful of the man. 
LUCIUS. O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil 
This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye; 
And here's the base fruit of her burning lust. 
AARON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood. 
LUCIUS. Too like the sire for ever being good. 
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl- 
A sight to vex the father's soul withal. 
AARON. Lucius, save the child, 
And bear it from me to the Emperess. 
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears, 
AARON. First know thou, I begot him on the Empress. 
Trim sport for them which had the doing of it. 
As sure a card as ever won the set; 
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay; 
I wrote the letter that thy father found, 
And hid the gold within that letter mention'd, 
Confederate with the Queen and her two sons; 
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand, 
I pried me through the crevice of a wall, 
And when I told the Empress of this sport, 
AARON. Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is. 
Even now I curse the day- and yet, I think, 
Few come within the compass of my curse- 
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it; 
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night, 
And bid the owners quench them with their tears. 
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees, 
LUCIUS. Bring down the devil, for he must not die 
Welcome, Aemilius. What's the news from Rome? 
AEMILIUS. Lord Lucius, and you Princes of the Goths, 
The Roman Emperor greets you all by me; 
LUCIUS. Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges 
Is it your trick to make me ope the door, 
Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more. 
Witness the tiring day and heavy night; 
I am Revenge, sent from th' infernal kingdom 
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind 
Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake. 
And whirl along with thee about the globes. 
Even from Hyperion's rising in the east 
Until his very downfall in the sea. 
TITUS. Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are! 
And you the Empress! But we worldly men 
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths, 
Or, at the least, make them his enemies. 
How like the Empress and her sons you are! 
For well I wot the Empress never wags 
TITUS. Look round about the wicked streets of Rome, 
Go thou with them; and in the Emperor's court 
I will bring in the Empress and her sons, 
The Emperor himself, and all thy foes; 
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths. 
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths; 
Tell him the Emperor and the Empress too 
Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor 
PUBLIUS. The Empress' sons, I take them: Chiron, Demetrius. 
The one is Murder, and Rape is the other's name; 
CHIRON. Villains, forbear! we are the Empress' sons. 
Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud; 
The basin that receives your guilty blood. 
And of the paste a coffin I will rear, 
Like to the earth, swallow her own increase. 
This is the feast that I have bid her to, 
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on; 
Receive the blood; and when that they are dead, 
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast. 
Now bring them in, for I will play the cook, 
Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies 
The court of TITUS' house 
Enter Lucius, MARCUS, and the GOTHS, with AARON prisoner, 
and his CHILD in the arms of an attendant 
Till he be brought unto the Empress' face 
And see the ambush of our friends be strong; 
I fear the Emperor means no good to us. 
The venomous malice of my swelling heart! 
The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand. 
SATURNINUS. What, hath the firmament more suns than one? 
MARCUS. Rome's Emperor, and nephew, break the parle; 
The feast is ready which the careful Titus 
[A table brought in. The company sit down] 
like a cook, placing the dishes, and LAVINIA 
And welcome all. Although the cheer be poor, 
My lord the Emperor, resolve me this: 
SATURNINUS. Because the girl should not survive her shame, 
For me, most wretched, to perform the like. 
SATURNINUS. What, was she ravish'd? Tell who did the deed. 
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred. 
[He stabs the EMPRESS] 
LUCIUS. Can the son's eye behold his father bleed? 
MARCUS, and their friends go up into the balcony] 
The story of that baleful burning night, 
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in 
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound. 
And break my utt'rance, even in the time 
Here's Rome's young Captain, let him tell the tale; 
That Chiron and the damn'd Demetrius 
And sent her enemies unto the grave. 
The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out, 
I am the turned forth, be it known to you, 
And from her bosom took the enemy's point, 
Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body. 
MARCUS. Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child. 
[Pointing to the CHILD in an attendant's arms] 
The issue of an irreligious Moor, 
The villain is alive in Titus' house, 
Now have you heard the truth: what say you, Romans? 
And, from the place where you behold us pleading, 
The poor remainder of Andronici 
And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls, 
The common voice do cry it shall be so. 
attendants. LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend 
The last true duties of thy noble son! 
O, were the sum of these that I should pay 
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave; 
Give sentence on the execrable wretch 
For the offence he dies. This is our doom. 
Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth. 
I should repent the evils I have done; 
LUCIUS. Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,

CALCHAS, a Trojan priest, taking part with the Greeks 
AGAMEMNON, the Greek general 
Troy and the Greek camp before it 
In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece 
The princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd, 
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships 
Fraught with the ministers and instruments 
Their crownets regal from th' Athenian bay 
The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen, 
With wanton Paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel. 
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge 
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch 
Sperr up the sons of Troy.

Beginning in the middle; starting thence away,

TROILUS. The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength, 
Less valiant than the virgin in the night, 
out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding. 
PANDARUS. Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting. 
PANDARUS. Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.

Whose height commands as subject all the vale, 
To see the battle. Hector, whose patience 
Before the sun rose he was harness'd light, 
And to the field goes he; where every flower 
ALEXANDER. The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks

hath the joints of every thing; but everything so out of joint

Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be,

Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is. 
The Grecian camp. Before AGAMEMNON'S tent 
The ample proposition that hope makes 
Fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters 
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd, 
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap, 
Infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain 
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim, 
And that unbodied figure of the thought 
But the protractive trials of great Jove 
The fineness of which metal is not found 
In fortune's love? For then the bold and coward, 
The wise and fool, the artist and unread, 
The hard and soft, seem all affin'd and kin. 
But in the wind and tempest of her frown 
Puffing at all, winnows the light away; 
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance 
Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth, 
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage 
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold 
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut, 
Bounding between the two moist elements 
Like Perseus' horse. Where's then the saucy boat, 
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze 
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind 
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks, 
And flies fled under shade-why, then the thing of courage 
In whom the tempers and the minds of all 
Besides the applause and approbation 
The which, [To AGAMEMNON] most mighty, for thy place and sway, 
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece 
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree 
On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears 
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master, 
The specialty of rule hath been neglected; 
When that the general is not like the hive, 
To whom the foragers shall all repair, 
Th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask. 
The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre, 
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol 
Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye 
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil, 
And posts, like the commandment of a king, 
Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets 
What raging of the sea, shaking of earth, 
Commotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors, 
The unity and married calm of states 
Which is the ladder of all high designs, 
The enterprise is sick! How could communities, 
The primogenity and due of birth, 
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters 
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores, 
And the rude son should strike his father dead; 
Follows the choking. 
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd 
By him one step below, he by the next, 
Exampl'd by the first pace that is sick 
The fever whereof all our power is sick. 
AGAMEMNON. The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses, 
What is the remedy? 
ULYSSES. The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns 
The sinew and the forehand of our host, 
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day 
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound 
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage- 
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd, 
The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling, 
That's done-as near as the extremest ends 
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age 
Must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit 
Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport 
Excitements to the field or speech for truce, 
NESTOR. And in the imitation of these twain- 
Count wisdom as no member of the war, 
But that of hand. The still and mental parts 
Of their observant toil, the enemies' weight- 
So that the ram that batters down the wall, 
For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise, 
They place before his hand that made the engine, 
Or those that with the fineness of their souls 
Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice 
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush 
The youthful Phoebus. 
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon? 
AGAMEMNON. This Troyan scorns us, or the men of Troy 
The worthiness of praise distains his worth, 
If that the prais'd himself bring the praise forth; 
But what the repining enemy commends, 
To set his sense on the attentive bent, 
AGAMEMNON. Speak frankly as the wind; 
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece 
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth 
The splinter of a lance. Even so much. 
As may be in the world. His youth in flood, 
And find the welcome of a noble foe. 
Blunt wedges rive hard knots. The seeded pride 
ULYSSES. This challenge that the gallant Hector sends, 
NESTOR. True. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance 
And, in the publication, make no strain 
ULYSSES. And wake him to the answer, think you? 
For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute 
In this vile action; for the success, 
Of good or bad unto the general; 
The baby figure of the giant mas 
Directive by the limbs. 
And think perchance they'll sell; if not, the lustre 
Of the better yet to show shall show the better, 
By showing the worst first. Do not consent 
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes, 
The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves 
Give him allowance for the better man; 
For that will physic the great Myrmidon, 
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off, 
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone. Exeunt

True swains in love shall in the world to come

Upbraid my falsehood when th' have said 'As false

Th' advantage of the time prompts me aloud 
That, through the sight I bear in things to come, 
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted- 
ULYSSES. Achilles stands i' th' entrance of his tent. 
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees. 
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way. 
ACHILLES. What comes the general to speak with me? 
NESTOR. Would you, my lord, aught with the general? 
AGAMEMNON. The better. 
ACHILLES. What, does the cuckold scorn me? 
Must fall out with men too. What the declin'd is, 
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others 
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer; 
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too, 
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me: 
To the first giver. 
The beauty that is borne here in the face 
The bearer knows not, but commends itself 
To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself- 
ULYSSES. I do not strain at the position- 
It is familiar-but at the author's drift; 
That no man is the lord of anything, 
Till he behold them formed in th' applause 
Where th' are extended; who, like an arch, reverb'rate 
The voice again; or, like a gate of steel 
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back 
Th' unknown Ajax. Heavens, what a man is there! 
What things again most dear in the esteem 
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes! 
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder, 
In monumental mock'ry. Take the instant way; 
Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path, 
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright, 
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear, 
That slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand; 
Grasps in the corner. The welcome ever smiles, 
Remuneration for the thing it was; 
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin- 
The present eye praises the present object. 
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax, 
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye 
Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee, 
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves, 
The reasons are more potent and heroical. 
The providence that's in a watchful state 
Finds bottom in th' uncomprehensive deeps; 
Keeps place with thought, and almost, like the gods, 
Durst never meddle-in the soul of state, 
All the commerce that you have had with Troy 
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing 
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break. Exit 
They think my little stomach to the war 
Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid

The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.

For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.

there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt 
him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says 
another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the 
Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it 
was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs. 
'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I' 
quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the

the greater. 
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture. 
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs. 
To hear me speak the message I am sent on. 
This is the letter to your ladyship. 
SILVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me; 
Though his false finger have profan'd the ring, 
The air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks 
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face, 
Our youth got me to play the woman's part, 
As if the garment had been made for me;

This is the ring you sent to Silvia. 
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root! 
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds, 
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all th' sins:

Come not within the measure of my wrath;

CLOWN. I would you had been by the ship-side, to have help'd her; 
So, let's see- it was told me I should be rich by the fairies. 
CLOWN. You're a made old man; if the sins of your youth are

Come, good boy, the next way home.

O'er sixteen years, and leave the growth untried

To th' freshest things now reigning, and make stale

services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee thine own 
take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I 
thankful to thee shall be my study; and my profit therein the

even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when saw'st thou the

angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the

For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.

With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing! 
The lark, that tirra-lirra chants, 
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,

To me the difference forges dread; your greatness 
Should pass this way, as you did. O, the Fates! 
The sternness of his presence? 
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves, 
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter 
Became a bull and bellow'd; the green Neptune 
A ram and bleated; and the fire-rob'd god, 
Oppos'd, as it must be, by th' pow'r of the King.

That you behold the while. Your guests are coming. 
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day 
At upper end o' th' table, now i' th' middle; 
With labour, and the thing she took to quench it 
The hostess of the meeting. Pray you bid

The marigold, that goes to bed wi' th' sun, 
I would I had some flow'rs o' th' spring that might 
From the flowers now that, frighted, thou let'st fall 
That come before the swallow dares, and take 
The winds of March with beauty; violets, dim 
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes

By th' pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out

Is at the nuptial of his son a guest 
That best becomes the table. Pray you, once more,

cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come 
in with whoobub against his daughter and the King's son and 
scar'd my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in 
the whole army. 
Yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange; 
the pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee, there's

And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale, 
Which fortified her visage from the sun, 
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw 
The carcase of a beauty spent and done. 
Laund'ring the silken figures in the brine 
As they did batt'ry to the spheres intend; 
To th' orbed earth; sometimes they do extend 
The mind and sight distractedly commixed. 
And, true to bondage, would not break from thence, 
Which she perused, sighed, tore, and gave the flood; 
This said, in top of rage the lines she rents, 
Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew 
The swiftest hours observed as they flew, 
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe. 
'Tis promised in the charity of age. 
The injury of many a blasting hour, 
And every light occasion of the wind 
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind; 
Whose bare out-bragged the web it seemed to wear: 
Proud of subjection, noble by the sway, 
Whether the horse by him became his deed, 
Or he his manage by th' well-doing steed. 
'But quickly on this side the verdict went: 
'So on the tip of his subduing tongue 
To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep, 
He had the dialect and different skill, 
'That he did in the general bosom reign 
Like fools that in th' imagination set 
The goodly objects which abroad they find 
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them. 
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower. 
Of proofs new-bleeding, which remained the foil 
The destined ill she must herself assay? 
To put the by-past perils in her way? 
To be forbod the sweets that seems so good 
The one a palate hath that needs will taste, 
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling; 
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind; 
'"Among the many that mine eyes have seen, 
Or my affection put to th' smallest teen, 
In bloodless white and the encrimsoned mood- 
With the annexions of fair gems enriched, 
'"The diamond? why, 'twas beautiful and hard, 
The deep-green em'rald, in whose fresh regard 
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend 
Of pensived and subdued desires the tender, 
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise; 
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote; 
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove 
The thing we have not, mast'ring what not strives, 
Playing the place which did no form receive, 
The scars of battle scapeth by the flight, 
The accident which brought me to her eye 
Upon the moment did her force subdue, 
And now she would the caged cloister fly. 
The broken bosoms that to me belong 
And sweetens, in the suff'ring pangs it bears, 
The aloes of all forces, shocks and fears. 
To leave the batt'ry that you make 'gainst mine, 
O, how the channel to the stream gave grace! 
Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses 
In the small orb of one particular tear! 
But with the inundation of the eyes 
Could scape the hail of his all-hurting aim, 
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;

The naked and concealed fiend he covered, 
That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,

Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: 
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive, 
Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet. 
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place, 
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: 
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds 
Mark how one string sweet husband to another, 
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, 
And your sweet semblance to some other give. 
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. 
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill. 
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood, 
To the wide world and all her fading sweets: 
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect, 
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, 
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought, 
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me. 
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight. 
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent, 
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, 
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive. 
Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone. 
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure, 
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give! 
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live: 
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so, 
Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made: 
Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said 
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life. 
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, 
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. 
O know sweet love I always write of you, 
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be. 
I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument 
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, 
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell, 
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell. 
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show. 
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, 
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame, 
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose! 
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell 
They were but sweet, but figures of delight: 
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, 
But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee. 
Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey, 
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight. 
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand 
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, 
Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine, 
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature, 
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, 
Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness, 
For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour, 
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st. 
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower, 
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st 
To thy sweet will making addition thus. 
Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil. 
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee. 
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet, 
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.

So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom. 
GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.

My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;

QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life

Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall. Exit. 
Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd! 
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks. 
Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet. 
By any other name would smell as sweet. 
Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, 
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! 
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest 
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. 
Jul. Sweet, so would I. 
Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, 
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! 
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? 
Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine. 
Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce. 
Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose? 
My words would bandy her to my sweet love, 
Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad? 
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news 
Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? 
Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet, 
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? 
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, 
Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. 
Some say the lark makes sweet division; 
For sweet discourses in our time to come. 
O sweet my mother, cast me not away! 
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love. 
1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. 
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd, 
Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew 
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew; 
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, 
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet; 
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed 
I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things. 
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. 
I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man 
for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man 
LUCENTIO. O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face, 
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her. 
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale 
For she is sweeter than perfume itself 
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale. 
But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers. 
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels. 
PETRUCHIO. Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed. 
BIANCA. Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone. 
And marry sweet Bianca with consent. 
To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife. 
Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate; 
TRANIO. Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it? 
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry. 
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I? 
LUCENTIO. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart. 
PETRUCHIO. How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort? 
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks. 
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too, 
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake. 
KATHERINA. Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, 
LUCENTIO. [Kneeling] Pardon, sweet father. 
VINCENTIO. Lives my sweet son? 
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake. 
PETRUCHIO. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate: 
And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy. 
And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.

ADRIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. 
SEBASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in 
Upon a sore injunction; my sweet mistress 
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, 
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.

And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past. 
Come, come, sweet Emperor; come, Andronicus. 
TAMORA. Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends. 
I will not be denied. Sweet heart, look back. 
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest 
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit, 
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds

Sweet huntsman- Bassianus 'tis we mean- 
CHIRON. Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands. 
Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments 
Which that sweet tongue hath made, 
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush. 
Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung 
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear! 
LUCIUS. Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief 
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise? 
LUCIUS. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son, 
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth. 
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean. 
Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator. 
Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt;

And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope; 
Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom sure. 
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome! 
With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous, 
And now, sweet Emperor, be blithe again, 
So sweet a death as hanging presently. 
O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;

Here are the number of results:   835
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: 
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive, 
Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet. 
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place, 
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy: 
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds 
Mark how one string sweet husband to another, 
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake, 
And your sweet semblance to some other give. 
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear. 
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill. 
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood, 
To the wide world and all her fading sweets: 
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect, 
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings, 
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought, 
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me. 
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight. 
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent, 
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave, 
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive. 
Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone. 
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure, 
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give! 
For that sweet odour, which doth in it live: 
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so, 
Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made: 
Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said 
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life. 
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, 
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. 
O know sweet love I always write of you, 
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be. 
I grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument 
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell, 
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell, 
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell. 
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show. 
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, 
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame, 
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose! 
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell 
They were but sweet, but figures of delight: 
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells, 
But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee. 
Rise resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey, 
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight. 
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand 
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, 
Nothing sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine, 
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature, 
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble, 
Even so being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness, 
For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour, 
Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow'st. 
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower, 
With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway'st 
To thy sweet will making addition thus. 
Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.

Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.

FALSTAFF. God save thee, my sweet boy! 
To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;

Under the sweet shade of your government. 
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful? 
Good bawcock, bate thy rage. Use lenity, sweet chuck. 
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty; 
What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet, 
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire 
Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast; 
The pretty and sweet manner of it forc'd

No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still. 
QUEEN. Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment'st thyself; 
And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium. 
To France, sweet Suffolk. Let me hear from thee; 
Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand

How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd! 
As, deathsmen, you have rid this sweet young prince! 
QUEEN MARGARET. Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.

Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were, 
My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd.

With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys. 
KING RICHARD. Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life 
Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him 
And ample interchange of sweet discourse 
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air 
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. 
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall. Exit. 
Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd! 
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks. 
Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet. 
By any other name would smell as sweet. 
Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, 
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! 
Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest 
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. 
Jul. Sweet, so would I. 
Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow, 
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! 
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? 
Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine. 
Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce. 
Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose? 
My words would bandy her to my sweet love, 
Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad? 
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news 
Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love? 
Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet, 
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh? 
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy, 
Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide. 
Some say the lark makes sweet division; 
For sweet discourses in our time to come. 
O sweet my mother, cast me not away! 
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love. 
1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound. 
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd, 
Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew 
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew; 
Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers, 
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet; 
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed 
I smell sweet savours, and I feel soft things. 
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. 
I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man 
for a husband, and then have to't afresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man 
LUCENTIO. O, yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face, 
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her. 
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale 
For she is sweeter than perfume itself 
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale. 
But slow in speech, yet sweet as springtime flowers. 
As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels. 
PETRUCHIO. Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed. 
BIANCA. Farewell, sweet masters, both; I must be gone. 
And marry sweet Bianca with consent. 
To this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife. 
Fear not, sweet wench; they shall not touch thee, Kate; 
TRANIO. Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it? 
Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry. 
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate, or else shall I? 
LUCENTIO. While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart. 
PETRUCHIO. How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort? 
I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks. 
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too, 
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake. 
KATHERINA. Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet, 
LUCENTIO. [Kneeling] Pardon, sweet father. 
VINCENTIO. Lives my sweet son? 
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake. 
PETRUCHIO. Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate: 
And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy. 
And, sweet sprites, the burden bear. 
With its sweet air; thence I have follow'd it, 
ADRIAN. The air breathes upon us here most sweetly. 
SEBASTIAN. 'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in 
Upon a sore injunction; my sweet mistress 
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, 
Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. 
GONZALO. Marvellous sweet music! 
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall 
PROSPERO. Sweet now, silence; 
MIRANDA. Sweet lord, you play me false. 
That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves, 
have use for 'em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung

The sweet degrees that this brief world affords

And sweetly felt it. 
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility, 
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge. 
SATURNINUS. Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go. 
LUCIUS. There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends, 
And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past. 
Come, come, sweet Emperor; come, Andronicus. 
TAMORA. Nay, nay, sweet Emperor, we must all be friends. 
I will not be denied. Sweet heart, look back. 
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest 
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit, 
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds 
TAMORA. Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life! 
LAVINIA. Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word. 
TAMORA. So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee; 
Sweet huntsman- Bassianus 'tis we mean- 
CHIRON. Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands. 
Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments 
Which that sweet tongue hath made, 
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush. 
Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung 
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear! 
LUCIUS. Sweet father, cease your tears; for at your grief 
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise? 
LUCIUS. Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son, 
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth. 
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean. 
Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator. 
Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt; 
TITUS. Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris'd, sweet girl, 
TITUS. Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends, 
MARCUS. Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me. 
And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope; 
Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom sure. 
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome! 
With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous, 
And now, sweet Emperor, be blithe again, 
So sweet a death as hanging presently. 
O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee; 
TITUS. I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell. 
Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear 
O, now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss! 
TROILUS. Sweet Pandarus! 
sweet niece Cressida. 
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue; 
Like one besotted on your sweet delights.

Benvolio, nephew to Montague, and friend to Romeo 
Balthasar, servant to Romeo. 
M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day? 
Enter Romeo. 
Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? 
This is not Romeo, he's some other where. 
Enter Benvolio and Romeo. 
Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad? 
Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; Torchbearers. 
Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance. 
Cap. Young Romeo is it? 
Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo. 
Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague, 
Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again, 
Enter Romeo alone. 
Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo! 
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! 
O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were 
Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed; 
Enter Romeo. 
Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? 
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, 
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name; 
Henceforth I never will be Romeo. 
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? 
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, 
Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. 
Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice 
With repetition of my Romeo's name. 
Romeo! 
Jul. Romeo! 
Enter Romeo. 
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night. 
Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be? 
Ben. Romeo will answer it. 
Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white

Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo? 
Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo. 
Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both. 
Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo. 
Enter Romeo. 
Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford 
Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies 
Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead! 
Ben. Romeo, away, be gone! 
Exit Romeo. 
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, 
Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay. 
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink 
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud, 
But by-and-by comes back to Romeo, 
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. 
Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live. 
Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio. 
Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend; 
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste, 
That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo 
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night; 
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die, 
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence. 
That Romeo bid thee fetch? 
Nurse. Romeo can, 
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo! 
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo! 
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,' 
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier! 
Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead? 
Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished; 
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished. 
Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? 
Shame come to Romeo! 
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.' 
'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word 
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, 
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'- 
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment. 
Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd. 
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead! 
Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo 
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night. 
Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man. 
Enter Romeo. 
But Romeo may not. More validity, 
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize 
But Romeo may not- he is banished. 
Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself. 
Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise; 
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo? 
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries, 
Romeo is coming. 
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window. 
Ere I again behold my Romeo! 
Lady. That same villain Romeo. 
With Romeo till I behold him- dead- 
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof, 
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate, 
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing 
Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam, 
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands; 
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd, 
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift; 
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. 
Because he married me before to Romeo? 
I wake before the time that Romeo 
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? 
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body 
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee. 
Enter Romeo. 
Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted. 
Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo? 
Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo? 
She will beshrew me much that Romeo 
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come- 
Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock, 
Romeo opens the tomb. 
Bal. Romeo. 
Friar. Romeo! 
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too? 
And there I am. Where is my Romeo? 
[Snatches Romeo's dagger.] 
She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body]. 
Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar]. 
2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard. 
Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,' 
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before, 
Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man, 
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet; 
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife. 
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo 
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo. 
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. 
Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this? 
Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie- 
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

KING HENRY. O fair Katherine, if you will love me soundly with your 
KING HENRY. An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel. 
KING HENRY. I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not blush to 
KING HENRY. What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men are 
KING HENRY. The Princess is the better English-woman. I' faith, 
find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my 
KING HENRY. Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for 
soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say'st thou, then, 
KING HENRY. No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of 
KING HENRY. No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure 
KING HENRY. No, faith, is't not, Kate; but thy speaking of my 
KING HENRY. Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask them. 
KING HENRY. No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise; do but 
such a boy; and for my English moiety take the word of a king and 
KING HENRY. Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in true 
fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good

KING HENRY. Upon that I kiss your hand, and I can you my queen. 
KING HENRY. Then I will kiss your lips, Kate. 
KING HENRY. Madame my interpreter, what says she? 
KING HENRY. To kiss. 
KING HENRY. It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss 
KING HENRY. O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, 
KING HENRY. I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how perfectly I

KING HENRY. I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait

KING HENRY. Is't so, my lords of England? 
WESTMORELAND. The king hath granted every article: 
Where your Majesty demands that the King of France, having any

Enter the KING, and attendants

KING HENRY. Then what intends these forces thou dost bring? 
May pass into the presence of a king, 
KING HENRY. The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou! 
KING HENRY. How art thou call'd? And what is thy degree? 
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king.

King did I call thee? No, thou art not king; 
Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown.

By that false woman as this king by thee.

To kings that fear their subjects' treachery? 
From London by the King was I press'd forth;

KING HENRY. Woe above woe! grief more than common grief! 
KING HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances 
Misthink the King, and not be satisfied! 
KING HENRY. Was ever king so griev'd for subjects' woe? 
KING HENRY. Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care, 
Here sits a king more woeful than you are. 
KING HENRY. Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter. 
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light. 
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do, 
That led calm Henry, though he were a king, 
There to be crowned England's royal King; 
Enter KING HENRY, disguised, with a prayer-book 
KING HENRY. From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love, 
This is the quondam King; let's seize upon him. 
KING HENRY. Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, 
KING HENRY. My Queen and son are gone to France for aid; 
Is thither gone to crave the French King's sister 
And in conclusion wins the King from her 
To strengthen and support King Edward's place. 
SECOND KEEPER. Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens? 
KING HENRY. More than I seem, and less than I was born to: 
And men may talk of kings, and why not I? 
SECOND KEEPER. Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king. 
KING HENRY. Why, so I am- in mind; and that's enough. 
SECOND KEEPER. But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown? 
KING HENRY. My crown is in my heart, not on my head; 
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy. 
SECOND KEEPER. Well, if you be a king crown'd with content, 
You are the king King Edward hath depos'd; 
KING HENRY. But did you never swear, and break an oath? 
KING HENRY. Where did you dwell when I was King of England? 
KING HENRY. I was anointed king at nine months old; 
My father and my grandfather were kings; 
For we were subjects but while you were king. 
KING HENRY. Why, am I dead? Do I not breathe a man? 
Go where you will, the King shall be commanded; 
And be you kings: command, and I'll obey.

KING EDWARD. 'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands. 
KING EDWARD. Lords, give us leave; I'll try this widow's wit. 
KING EDWARD. Now tell me, madam, do you love your children? 
KING EDWARD. And would you not do much to do them good? 
KING EDWARD. Then get your husband's lands, to do them good. 
KING EDWARD. I'll tell you how these lands are to be got. 
KING EDWARD. What service wilt thou do me if I give them? 
KING EDWARD. But you will take exceptions to my boon. 
KING EDWARD. Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask. 
KING EDWARD. An easy task; 'tis but to love a king. 
KING EDWARD. Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee. 
KING EDWARD. But stay thee- 'tis the fruits of love I mean.

Proud setter up and puller down of kings!

KING EDWARD. Now, messenger, what letters or what news 
KING EDWARD. Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief, 
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters? 
'Go tell false Edward, the supposed king, 
KING EDWARD. IS Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry. 
KING EDWARD. I blame not her: she could say little less;

Thou call'dst me King? 
Then I degraded you from being King,

Edward will always bear himself as King. 
WARWICK. Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king; 
And be true King indeed; thou but the shadow. 
KING EDWARD. What fates impose, that men must needs abide; 
To free King Henry from imprisonment, 
What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?

Thus stands the case: you know our King, my brother, 
Enter KING EDWARD and a HUNTSMAN with him

I came to serve a king and not a duke. 
KING EDWARD. Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we'll debate 
If you'll not here proclaim yourself our King,

Call Edward King, and at his hands beg mercy? 
GLOUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King; 
KING EDWARD. Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift. 
And Henry is my King, Warwick his subject. 
KING EDWARD. But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner. 
The king was slily finger'd from the deck! 
KING EDWARD. 'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.

KING EDWARD. So other foes may set upon our backs.

With slaughter coupled to the name of kings. 
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire! 
In undetermin'd differences of kings. 
Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,

KING PHILIP. Know him in us that here hold up his right. 
KING JOHN. In us that are our own great deputy 
Be by some certain king purg'd and depos'd. 
BASTARD. By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings, 
KING JOHN. Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads, 
Then after fight who shall be king of it? 
BASTARD. An if thou hast the mettle of a king, 
KING PHILIP. Let it be so. Say, where will you assault? 
KING JOHN. We from the west will send destruction

Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings. 
KING JOHN. Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear. 
Two such controlling bounds, shall you be, Kings, 
KING PHILIP. Speak England first, that hath been forward first

KING PHILIP. I am perplex'd and know not what to say. 
KING PHILIP. Good reverend father, make my person yours, 
The fearful difference of incensed kings.

KING JOHN. Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman. 
KING JOHN. My mother dead!

KING JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be attended 
KING JOHN. O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth 
And thou, to be endeared to a king, 
KING JOHN. Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause, 
KING JOHN. Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers, 
The King by me requests your presence straight. 
SALISBURY. The King hath dispossess'd himself of us. 
The practice and the purpose of the King;

KING JOHN. This fever that hath troubled me so long 
KING JOHN. Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there. 
KING JOHN. Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up 
SALISBURY. I did not think the King so stor'd with friends. 
PEMBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field. 
Seek out King John, and fall before his feet; 
Commend me to one Hubert, with your King; 
Even to our ocean, to great King John. 
King John did fly an hour or two before 
HUBERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk; 
Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King 
At whose request the King hath pardon'd them, 
Away, before! conduct me to the King; 
KING JOHN in a chair 
KING JOHN. Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room; 
KING JOHN. Poison'd-ill-fare! Dead, forsook, cast off;

KING RICHARD. I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill. 
Landlord of England art thou now, not King. 
KING RICHARD. A lunatic lean-witted fool, 
KING RICHARD. And let them die that age and sullens have; 
KING RICHARD. Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his; 
KING RICHARD. What says he? 
KING RICHARD. The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he; 
KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the matter? 
Be not thyself-for how art thou a king 
KING RICHARD. Think what you will, we seize into our hands 
KING RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight; 
Flourish. Exeunt KING, QUEEN, BUSHY, AUMERLE, 
The King is not himself, but basely led 
That will the King severely prosecute 
WILLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. His noble kinsman-most degenerate king! 
The first departing of the King for Ireland. 
You promis'd, when you parted with the King, 
QUEEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself 
More than with parting from my lord the King. 
I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland. 
The King had cut off my head with my brother's. 
Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd, 
GREEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love 
Is near the hate of those love not the King. 
BUSHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd. 
Because we ever have been near the King. 
The household of the King. 
Com'st thou because the anointed King is hence? 
Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind, 
If that my cousin king be King in England, 
Unto the sovereign mercy of the King; 
And yet we hear no tidings from the King; 
The King reposeth all his confidence in thee. 
CAPTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay. 
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings. 
As well assur'd Richard their King is dead. Exit 
You have misled a prince, a royal king, 
Near to the King in blood, and near in love 
Drums. Flourish and colours. Enter the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, 
KING RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand? 
KING RICHARD. Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy 
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king 
CARLISLE. Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king 
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all. 
KING RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not 
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king; 
KING RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men 
KING RICHARD. I had forgot myself; am I not King? 
Is not the King's name twenty thousand names? 
Ye favourites of a king; are we not high? 
KING RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd. 
KING RICHARD. Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so in. 
KING RICHARD. O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption! 
KING RICHARD. No matter where-of comfort no man speak. 
And tell sad stories of the death of kings: 
That rounds the mortal temples of a king 
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king! 
How can you say to me I am a king? 
KING RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come 
KING RICHARD. Thou hast said enough. 
A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey. 
KING RICHARD. He does me double wrong 
Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed 
To say 'King Richard.' Alack the heavy day 
When such a sacred king should hide his head! 
Why, it contains no king? 
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies 
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand, 
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land, 
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet 
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks. 
Enter on the walls, the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, 
See, see, King Richard doth himself appear, 
YORK. Yet he looks like a king. Behold, his eye, 
KING RICHARD. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] We are amaz'd; and thus long 
Because we thought ourself thy lawful King; 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King 
KING RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns: 
KING RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine 
KING RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit? 
The King shall do it. Must he be depos'd? 
The King shall be contented. Must he lose 
The name of king? A God's name, let it go. 
Or I'll be buried in the king's high way, 
What says King Bolingbroke? Will his Majesty 
KING RICHARD. Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon, 
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base, 
In the base court? Come down? Down, court! down, king! 
Enter the KING, and his attendants, below 
KING RICHARD. Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee 
KING RICHARD. Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all. 
KING RICHARD. Well you deserve. They well deserve to have 
KING RICHARD. Then I must not say no. Flourish. Exeunt 
Hath seiz'd the wasteful King. O, what pity is it 
SERVANT. What, think you the King shall be deposed? 
Why dost thou say King Richard is depos'd? 
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold 
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down. 
To meet at London London's King in woe. 
Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd 
What subject can give sentence on his king? 
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king. 
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king, 
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king; 
Re-enter YORK, with KING RICHARD, and OFFICERS 
KING RICHARD. Alack, why am I sent for to a king, 
God save the King! Will no man say amen? 
God save the King! although I be not he; 
KING RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown. 
KING RICHARD. My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine. 
But not my griefs; still am I king of those. 
KING RICHARD. Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down. 
KING RICHARD. Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be; 
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart; 
God save King Henry, unking'd Richard says, 
KING RICHARD. Must I do so? And must I ravel out 
Containing the deposing of a king 
KING RICHARD. Mine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see. 
T'undeck the pompous body of a king; 
KING RICHARD. No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man, 
O that I were a mockery king of snow, 
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good, 
KING RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell. 
KING RICHARD. They shall be satisfied. I'll read enough, 
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport- 
KING RICHARD. Say that again. 
There lies the substance; and I thank thee, king, 
KING RICHARD. Fair cousin! I am greater than a king; 
For when I was a king, my flatterers 
I have a king here to my flatterer. 
KING RICHARD. And shall I have? 
KING RICHARD. Then give me leave to go. 
KING RICHARD. Whither you will, so I were from your sights. 
KING RICHARD. O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all, 
That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall. 
Exeunt KING RICHARD, some Lords and a Guard 
QUEEN. This way the King will come; this is the way 
Have any resting for her true King's queen. 
Enter KING RICHARD and Guard 
Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb, 
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn, 
KING RICHARD. Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so, 
Which art a lion and the king of beasts? 
KING RICHARD. A king of beasts, indeed! If aught but beasts, 
I had been still a happy king of men. 
For the deposing of a rightful king. 
KING RICHARD. Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal 
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again, 
KING RICHARD. Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate 
KING RICHARD. Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart. 
QUEEN. Banish us both, and send the King with me. 
KING RICHARD. So two, together weeping, make one woe. 
KING RICHARD. Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short, 
KING RICHARD. We make woe wanton with this fond delay. 
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head. 
And lasting fealty to the new-made king. 
YORK. Bring me my boots. I will unto the King. 
To kill the King at Oxford. 
Spur post, and get before him to the King, 
Enter BOLINGBROKE as King, PERCY, and other LORDS 
AUMERLE. Where is the King? 
YORK. [Within] Open the door, secure, foolhardy King. 
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, King; 
DUCHESS. [Within] A woman, and thine aunt, great King; 'tis I. 
And now chang'd to 'The Beggar and the King.' 
DUCHESS. O King, believe not this hard-hearted man! 
Say 'pardon,' King; let pity teach thee how. 
No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet. 
YORK. Speak it in French, King, say 'pardonne moy.' 
EXTON. Didst thou not mark the King, what words he spake? 
Meaning the King at Pomfret. Come, let's go. 
I am the King's friend, and will rid his foe. Exeunt 
Enter KING RICHARD 
KING RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare 
And none contented. Sometimes am I king; 
Persuades me I was better when a king; 
KING RICHARD. Thanks, noble peer! 
GROOM. I was a poor groom of thy stable, King, 
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York, 
KING RICHARD. Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend, 
KING RICHARD. So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back! 
KING RICHARD. If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away. 
KING RICHARD. Taste of it first as thou art wont to do. 
Who lately came from the King, commands the contrary. 
KING RICHARD. The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee! 
KING RICHARD. How now! What means death in this rude assault? 
Hath with the King's blood stain'd the King's own land. 
This dead King to the living King I'll bear. 
Thy kingly doom, and sentence of his pride. 
EXTON. Great King, within this coffin I present

Is the King dead, the empire unpossess'd? 
And who is England's King but great York's heir?

And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd, 
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift; 
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. 
Because he married me before to Romeo?

Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? 
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, 
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name; 
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

But by-and-by comes back to Romeo, 
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly. 
Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.

Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;

All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-

Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo

BOOK: THE SONNETS 
But as the riper should by time decease, 
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, 
And only herald to the gaudy spring, 
Pity the world, or else this glutton be, 
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. 
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days; 
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest, 
Now is the time that face should form another, 
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. 
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? 
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb, 
Calls back the lovely April of her prime, 
The bounteous largess given thee to give? 
Which used lives th' executor to be. 
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell 
Will play the tyrants to the very same, 
Which happies those that pay the willing loan; 
Lo in the orient when the gracious light 
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill, 
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day, 
The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are 
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds, 
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear: 
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife, 
The world will be thy widow and still weep, 
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend 
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; 
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end, 
And kept unused the user so destroys it: 
If all were minded so, the times should cease, 
And threescore year would make the world away: 
When I do count the clock that tells the time, 
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night, 
When I behold the violet past prime, 
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd 
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard: 
That thou among the wastes of time must go, 
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day 
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck, 
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment. 
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky: 
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay, 
Now stand you on the top of happy hours, 
So should the lines of life that life repair 
If I could write the beauty of your eyes, 
The age to come would say this poet lies, 
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, 
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, 
Devouring Time blunt thou the lion's paws, 
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood, 
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws, 
And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood, 
To the wide world and all her fading sweets: 
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion, 
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth, 
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart, 
As an unperfect actor on the stage, 
The perfect ceremony of love's rite, 
O let my looks be then the eloquence, 
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled, 
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held, 
For through the painter must you see his skill, 
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun 
They draw but what they see, know not the heart. 
But as the marigold at the sun's eye, 
The painful warrior famoused for fight, 
Is from the book of honour razed quite, 
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled: 
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired, 
Looking on darkness which the blind do see. 
That am debarred the benefit of rest? 
The one by toil, the other to complain 
I tell the day to please him thou art bright, 
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven: 
So flatter I the swart-complexioned night, 
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even. 
(Like to the lark at break of day arising 
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought, 
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought, 
And moan th' expense of many a vanished sight. 
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan, 
But if the while I think on thee (dear friend) 
As interest of the dead, which now appear, 
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live, 
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone, 
And thou (all they) hast all the all of me. 
Compare them with the bett'ring of the time, 
Exceeded by the height of happier men. 
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye, 
Kissing with golden face the meadows green; 
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride, 
And from the forlorn world his visage hide 
The region cloud hath masked him from me now. 
Suns of the world may stain, when heaven's sun staineth. 
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break, 
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face, 
That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace: 
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss, 
Th' offender's sorrow lends but weak relief 
To him that bears the strong offence's cross. 
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me, 
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth 
The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise. 
When thou art all the better part of me? 
To entertain the time with thoughts of love, 
But here's the joy, my friend and I are one, 
For all the day they view things unrespected, 
To the clear day with thy much clearer light, 
By looking on thee in the living day, 
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, 
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee, 
As soon as think the place where he would be. 
The other two, slight air, and purging fire, 
The first my thought, the other my desire, 
How to divide the conquest of thy sight, 
My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right, 
But the defendant doth that plea deny, 
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, 
The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part. 
And each doth good turns now unto the other, 
And to the painted banquet bids my heart: 
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief. 
Within the gentle closure of my breast, 
And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear, 
When love converted from the thing it was 
Within the knowledge of mine own desert, 
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part, 
To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws, 
How heavy do I journey on the way, 
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend.' 
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe, 
As if by some instinct the wretch did know 
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on, 
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence, 
From where thou art, why should I haste me thence? 
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind, 
So am I as the rich whose blessed key, 
The which he will not every hour survey, 
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure. 
Or captain jewels in the carcanet. 
So is the time that keeps you as my chest 
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide, 
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit, 
Speak of the spring, and foison of the year, 
The one doth shadow of your beauty show, 
The other as your bounty doth appear, 
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem 
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye, 
As the perfumed tincture of the roses, 
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments 
And broils root out the work of masonry, 
The living record of your memory. 
Even in the eyes of all posterity 
That wear this world out to the ending doom. 
So till the judgment that your self arise, 
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness: 
Let this sad interim like the ocean be 
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new, 
Come daily to the banks, that when they see: 
Return of love, more blest may be the view. 
Upon the hours, and times of your desire? 
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour, 
Whilst I (my sovereign) watch the clock for you, 
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour, 
Or at your hand th' account of hours to crave, 
Th' imprisoned absence of your liberty, 
The second burthen of a former child! 
Even of five hundred courses of the sun, 
That I might see what the old world could say, 
Or whether revolution be the same. 
O sure I am the wits of former days, 
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, 
Nativity once in the main of light, 
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth, 
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow, 
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth, 
My heavy eyelids to the weary night? 
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy? 
To play the watchman ever for thy sake. 
Stealing away the treasure of his spring: 
The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age, 
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain 
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore, 
And the firm soil win of the watery main, 
Against the wrackful siege of batt'ring days, 
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn, 
Before the golden tresses of the dead, 
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away, 
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view, 
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend: 
All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due, 
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown. 
They look into the beauty of thy mind, 
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds: 
The soil is this, that thou dost common grow. 
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair, 
The ornament of beauty is suspect, 
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time, 
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love, 
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days, 
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell 
Give warning to the world that I am fled 
The hand that writ it, for I love you so, 
Lest the wise world should look into your moan, 
O lest the world should task you to recite, 
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold, 
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. 
In me thou seest the twilight of such day, 
As after sunset fadeth in the west, 
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire, 
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, 
As the death-bed, whereon it must expire, 
The very part was consecrate to thee, 
The earth can have but earth, which is his due, 
My spirit is thine the better part of me, 
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life, 
The prey of worms, my body being dead, 
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife, 
The worth of that, is that which it contains, 
Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground; 
And for the peace of you I hold such strife 
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure, 
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure, 
Why with the time do I not glance aside 
Why write I still all one, ever the same, 
For as the sun is daily new and old, 
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show, 
Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing, 
Have added feathers to the learned's wing, 
In others' works thou dost but mend the style, 
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen, 
And in the praise thereof spends all his might, 
But since your worth (wide as the ocean is) 
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear, 
The worst was this, my love was my decay. 
Though I (once gone) to all the world must die, 
The earth can yield me but a common grave, 
When all the breathers of this world are dead, 
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men. 
The dedicated words which writers use 
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days. 
In whose confine immured is the store, 
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed. 
And to the most of praise add something more, 
Then others, for the breath of words respect, 
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse, 
Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you, 
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew? 
I was not sick of any fear from thence. 
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing: 
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, 
And place my merit in the eye of scorn, 
The injuries that to my self I do, 
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross, 
join with the spite of fortune, make me bow, 
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe, 
But in the onset come, so shall I taste 
At first the very worst of fortune's might. 
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest, 
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs, 
When in the least of them my life hath end, 
In many's looks, the false heart's history 
Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell. 
That do not do the thing, they most do show, 
Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces, 
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet, 
The basest weed outbraves his dignity: 
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame, 
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose, 
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name! 
That tongue that tells the story of thy days, 
The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge. 
As on the finger of a throned queen, 
The basest jewel will be well esteemed: 
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray, 
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state! 
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! 
The teeming autumn big with rich increase, 
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, 
And thou away, the very birds are mute. 
That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near. 
From you have I been absent in the spring, 
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell 
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white, 
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose, 
The forward violet thus did I chide, 
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride 
The lily I condemned for thy hand, 
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand, 
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem, 
I love not less, though less the show appear, 
The owner's tongue doth publish every where. 
Our love was new, and then but in the spring, 
Not that the summer is less pleasant now 
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night, 
The argument all bare is of more worth 
To mar the subject that before was well? 
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride, 
In process of the seasons have I seen, 
When in the chronicle of wasted time, 
I see descriptions of the fairest wights, 
Then in the blazon of sweet beauty's best, 
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul, 
Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come, 
Can yet the lease of my true love control, 
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured, 
And the sad augurs mock their own presage, 
Now with the drops of this most balmy time, 
What's in the brain that ink may character, 
I must each day say o'er the very same, 
Weighs not the dust and injury of age, 
Finding the first conceit of love there bred, 
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged, 
And made my self a motley to the view, 
Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best, 
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds, 
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand, 
And almost thence my nature is subdued 
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand: 
Your love and pity doth th' impression fill, 
You are my all the world, and I must strive, 
That all the world besides methinks are dead. 
For it no form delivers to the heart 
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part, 
For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight, 
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature, 
The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night: 
The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature. 
Drink up the monarch's plague this flattery? 
O 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing, 
And to his palate doth prepare the cup. 
If it be poisoned, 'tis the lesser sin, 
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents, 
Divert strong minds to the course of alt'ring things: 
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest? 
Let me not to the marriage of true minds 
Or bends with the remover to remove. 
It is the star to every wand'ring bark, 
But bears it out even to the edge of doom: 
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds 
Bring me within the level of your frown, 
The constancy and virtue of your love. 
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured, 
But thence I learn and find the lesson true, 
In the distraction of this madding fever! 
The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits! 
And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed, 
Or at the least, so long as brain and heart 
Not wond'ring at the present, nor the past, 
If my dear love were but the child of state, 
Under the blow of thralled discontent, 
Whereto th' inviting time our fashion calls: 
To this I witness call the fools of time, 
Were't aught to me I bore the canopy, 
With my extern the outward honouring, 
In the old age black was not counted fair, 
Fairing the foul with art's false borrowed face, 
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds, 
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand, 
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand. 
Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame 
On purpose laid to make the taker mad. 
All this the world well knows yet none knows well, 
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell. 
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun, 
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks. 
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground. 
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel. 
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan; 
And thence this slander as I think proceeds. 
And truly not the morning sun of heaven 
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east, 
Nor that full star that ushers in the even 
Doth half that glory to the sober west 
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take, 
He pays the whole, and yet am I not free. 
The sea all water, yet receives rain still, 
'Will', will fulfil the treasure of thy love, 
Then in the number let me pass untold, 
Yet what the best is, take the worst to be. 
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride, 
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied? 
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place? 
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties. 
Although she knows my days are past the best, 
O call not me to justify the wrong, 
The manner of my pity-wanting pain. 
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man, 
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay: 
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind. 
The better angel is a man right fair: 
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill. 
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate', 
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth, 
For that which longer nurseth the disease, 
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill, 
Th' uncertain sickly appetite to please: 
My reason the physician to my love, 
At random from the truth vainly expressed. 
What means the world to say it is not so? 
The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears. 
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes? 
To make me give the lie to my true sight, 
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day? 
That in the very refuse of thy deeds, 
The more I hear and see just cause of hate? 
Or made them swear against the thing they see. 
To swear against the truth so foul a be.

We wish it ours again; the present pleasure, 
The opposite of itself. She's good, being gone; 
The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on. 
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,

The sides o' th' world may danger. Much is breeding

It cannot be thus long; the sides of nature

What says the married woman? You may go. 
ANTONY. The gods best know- 
So mightily betray'd! Yet at the first 
I saw the treasons planted. 
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods, 
Then was the time for words. No going then! 
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, 
Art turn'd the greatest liar. 
The strong necessity of time commands 
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome; 
Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength, 
Are newly grown to love. The condemn'd Pompey,

Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; 
The garboils she awak'd. At the last, best.

As you shall give th' advice. By the fire 
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears

The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike 
Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy 
A man who is the abstract of all faults 
His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven, 
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy, 
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave, 
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet 
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones 
That only have fear'd Caesar. To the ports 
The discontents repair, and men's reports 
It hath been taught us from the primal state 
And the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love, 
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream, 
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide, 
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound 
They make in Italy; the borders maritime 
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle 
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge; 
Yea, like the stag when snow the pasture sheets, 
The barks of trees thou brows'd. On the Alps 
Did show ourselves i' th' field; and to that end 
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!

MENAS. I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage 
than the love of the parties. 
ENOBARBUS. I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems 
to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of

And though you think me poor, I am the man 
Will give thee all the world.

Thou art, if thou dar'st be, the earthly Jove;

Enter the MESSENGER as before 
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led 
The fellow has good judgment. 
CLEOPATRA. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so. 
CLEOPATRA. The man hath seen some majesty, and should know. 
When the best hint was given him, he not took't, 
The good gods will mock me presently 
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no mid-way 
Yourself shall go between's. The meantime, lady, 
I'll raise the preparation of a war 
The Jove of power make me, most weak, most weak, 
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men 
Should solder up the rift. 
ENOBARBUS. This is old. What is the success? 
EROS. Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst Pompey, 
presently denied him rivality, would not let him partake in the 
glory of the action; and not resting here, accuses him of letters 
So the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine. 
And throw between them all the food thou hast, 
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony? 
EROS. He's walking in the garden- thus, and spurns 
The rush that lies before him; cries 'Fool Lepidus!' 
And threats the throat of that his officer 
In Alexandria. Here's the manner of't: 
I' th' market-place, on a tribunal silver'd, 
Were publicly enthron'd; at the feet sat 
And all the unlawful issue that their lust 
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her 
MAECENAS. This in the public eye? 
CAESAR. I' th' common show-place, where they exercise. 
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings: 
In th' habiliments of the goddess Isis

His part o' th' isle. Then does he say he lent me 
That Lepidus of the triumvirate 
Demand the like. 
Like Caesar's sister. The wife of Antony 
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach 
Long ere she did appear. The trees by th' way 
Longing for what it had not. Nay, the dust 
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven, 
The ostentation of our love, which left unshown 
And his affairs come to me on the wind. 
The kings o' th' earth for war. He hath assembled 
Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus 
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas; 
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia, with 
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives 
Beyond the mark of thought, and the high gods,

Here comes the Emperor. 
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea, 
Than by the negligent. 
Which might have well becom'd the best of men 
The absolute soldiership you have by land; 
The way which promises assurance; and 
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from th' head of Actium 
Beat th' approaching Caesar. But if we fail, 
MESSENGER. The news is true, my lord: he is descried; 
This sword and these my wounds? Let th' Egyptians 
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we 
Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth 
SOLDIER. By Hercules, I think I am i' th' right. 
Not in the power on't. So our leader's led, 
The legions and the horse whole, do you not? 
CANIDIUS. Well I know the man. 
MESSENGER. The Emperor calls Canidius. 
CANIDIUS. With news the time's with labour and throes forth 
The prescript of this scroll. Our fortune lies 
Another part of the plain 
ANTONY. Set we our squadrons on yon side o' th' hill, 
We may the number of the ships behold, 
Another part of the plain 
over the stage, and TAURUS, the Lieutenant of 
CAESAR, the other way. After their going in is heard 
the noise of a sea-fight 
Th' Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral, 
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder. 
All the whole synod of them! 
SCARUS. The greater cantle of the world is lost 
ENOBARBUS. How appears the fight? 
SCARUS. On our side like the token'd pestilence, 
Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i' th' midst o' th' fight, 
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder- 
The breese upon her, like a cow in June- 
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not 
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, 
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her. 
CANIDIUS. Our fortune on the sea is out of breath, 
Show me the way of yielding. 
The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason 
Sits in the wind against me. Exeunt 
ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't; 
I am so lated in the world that I 
My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O, 
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white 
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them 
Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint 
Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straight way. 
The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I 
That the mad Brutus ended; he alone 
In the brave squares of war. Yet now- no matter. 
EROS. The Queen, my lord, the Queen! 
EROS. Most noble sir, arise; the Queen approaches. 
Your comfort makes the rescue. 
EROS. Sir, the Queen. 
My heart was to thy rudder tied by th' strings, 
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods 
To the young man send humble treaties, dodge 
And palter in the shifts of lowness, who 
With half the bulk o' th' world play'd as I pleas'd, 
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf 
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth, 
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs, 
I have no ears to his request. The Queen 
CAESAR. Bring him through the bands. Exit EUPHRONIUS 
The ne'er-touch'd vestal. Try thy cunning, Thyreus; 
The itch of his affection should not then 
When half to half the world oppos'd, he being 
The mered question. 'Twas a shame no less 
Enter EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador; with ANTONY 
ANTONY. The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she 
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head, 
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim 
ANTONY. To him again. Tell him he wears the rose 
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note 
Under the service of a child as soon 
As i' th' command of Caesar. I dare him therefore 
Unstate his happiness, and be stag'd to th' show 
Do draw the inward quality after them, 
Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will 
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose 
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir. Exit SERVANT 
The loyalty well held to fools does make 
And earns a place i' th' story. 
THYREUS. The scars upon your honour, therefore, he 
The universal landlord. 
The doom of Egypt. 
If that the former dare but what it can, 
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest 
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries 
So saucy with the hand of she here- what's her name 
Bring him again: the Jack of Caesar's shall 
Forborne the getting of a lawful race, 
O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes, 
Upon the hill of Basan to outroar 
The horned herd! For I have savage cause, 
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank 
The white hand of a lady fever thee! 
Into th' abysm of hell. If he mislike 
The fall of Antony. 
And poison it in the source, and the first stone 
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite! 
Till by degrees the memory of my womb, 
By the discandying of this pelleted storm, 
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile 
If from the field I shall return once more 
Let's mock the midnight bell. 
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen, 
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight 
ENOBARBUS. Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious 
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still 
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek 
Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know 
Know that to-morrow the last of many battles 
And feast the army; we have store to do't, 
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony! Exeunt 
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood 
Out of the mind. 
SERVANT. The gods forbid! 
May be it is the period of your duty. 
And the gods yield you for't! 
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus! 
FIRST SOLDIER. Brother, good night. To-morrow is the day. 
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets? 
[The two companies separate and place themselves 
in every corner of the stage] 
[Music of the hautboys is under the stage] 
THIRD SOLDIER. Music i' th' air. 
FOURTH SOLDIER. Under the earth. 
SECOND SOLDIER. 'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov'd, 
FIRST SOLDIER. Follow the noise so far as we have quarter; 
The armourer of my heart. False, false; this, this. 
The royal occupation! Thou shouldst see 
And at the port expect you. 
CAPTAIN. The morn is fair. Good morrow, General. 
This morning, like the spirit of a youth 
SOLDIER. The gods make this a happy day to Antony! 
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier 
CAESAR. Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight. 
CAESAR. The time of universal peace is near. 
Prove this a prosp'rous day, the three-nook'd world 
Shall bear the olive freely. 
Is come into the field. 
Plant those that have revolted in the vant, 
Casaer hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest 
His bounty overplus. The messenger 
I tell you true. Best you saf'd the bringer 
Out of the host. I must attend mine office, 
ENOBARBUS. I am alone the villain of the earth, 
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits 
Field of battle between the camps 
Under the walls of Alexandria 
And let the Queen know of our gests. To-morrow, 
Before the sun shall see's, we'll spill the blood 
Not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been 
Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends, 
Wash the congealment from your wounds and kiss 
The honour'd gashes whole. 
Make her thanks bless thee. O thou day o' th' world, 
Ride on the pants triumphing. 
The world's great snare uncaught? 
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them. 
Had our great palace the capacity 
And drink carouses to the next day's fate, 
With brazen din blast you the city's ear; 
We must return to th' court of guard. The night 
By th' second hour i' th' morn. 
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me, 
Against the flint and hardness of my fault, 
But let the world rank me in register 
CENTURION. Let's hear him, for the things he speaks 
CENTURION. The hand of death hath raught him. 
[Drums afar off ] Hark! the drums 
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him 
To th' court of guard; he is of note. Our hour 
He may recover yet. Exeunt with the body 
Between the two camps 
ANTONY. I would they'd fight i' th' fire or i' th' air; 
Upon the hills adjoining to the city 
They have put forth the haven- 
Between the camps 
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales, 
In Cleopatra's sails their nests. The augurers 
My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder 
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts 
Beguil'd me to the very heart of loss. 
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians; 
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot 
The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me, 
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' th' moon, 
And with those hands that grasp'd the heaviest club 
Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die. 
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall 
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly 
The soul and body rive not more in parting 
CLEOPATRA. To th' monument! 
Say that the last I spoke was 'Antony' 
And bring me how he takes my death. To th' monument! 
With trees upon't that nod unto the world 
The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct, 
I made these wars for Egypt; and the Queen- 
She hath betray'd me, and shall die the death. 
Is done unto thy hand. The last she spake 
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break 
The name of Antony; it was divided 
ANTONY. Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done, 
The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep 
The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides! 
All length is torture. Since the torch is out, 
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze. 
And all the haunt be ours.- Come, Eros, Eros! 
I have liv'd in such dishonour that the gods 
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back 
The courage of a woman; less noble mind 
That, when the exigent should come- which now 
Th' inevitable prosecution of 
Thou then wouldst kill me. Do't; the time is come. 
EROS. The gods withhold me! 
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts, 
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat 
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies. 
The thing why thou hast drawn it. 
EROS. Why, there then! Thus do I escape the sorrow 
The guard, ho! O, dispatch me! 
FIRST GUARD. What's the noise? 
SECOND GUARD. The star is fall'n. 
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come, 
DIOMEDES. What, ho! the Emperor's guard! The guard, what ho! 
Enter four or five of the guard of ANTONY 
'Tis the last service that I shall command you. 
Look out o' th' other side your monument; 
Enter, below, ANTONY, borne by the guard 
Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in! Darkling stand 
The varying shore o' th' world. O Antony, 
Of many thousand kisses the poor last 
Lest I be taken. Not th' imperious show 
Of the full-fortun'd Caesar ever shall 
That makes the weight. Had I great Juno's power, 
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up, 
That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel, 
ANTONY. The miserable change now at my end 
Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o' th' world, 
The noblest; and do now not basely die, 
The crown o' th' earth doth melt. My lord! 
O, wither'd is the garland of the war, 
The soldier's pole is fall'n! Young boys and girls 
Are level now with men. The odds is gone, 
Beneath the visiting moon. [Swoons] 
By such poor passion as the maid that milks 
And does the meanest chares. It were for me 
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods; 
To rush into the secret house of death 
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion, 
But resolution and the briefest end. 
The pauses that he makes. 
Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY 
CAESAR. The breaking of so great a thing should make 
A greater crack. The round world 
And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony 
Is not a single doom; in the name lay 
A moiety of the world. 
Which writ his honour in the acts it did 
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it, 
Splitted the heart. This is his sword; 
The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings 
To wash the eyes of kings. 
In the whole world. But yet let me lament, 
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts, 
Friend and companion in the front of war, 
The arm of mine own body, and the heart 
The business of this man looks out of him; 
EGYPTIAN. A poor Egyptian, yet the Queen, my mistress, 
To th' way she's forc'd to. 
EGYPTIAN. So the gods preserve thee! Exit 
The quality of her passion shall require, 
Alexandria. The monument 
Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug, 
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's. 
Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS, 
PROCULEIUS. Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt, 
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn 
Look him i' th' face. 
Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the 
and come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the guard 
unbar and open the gates 
Th' undoing of yourself. Let the world see 
Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye 
And show me to the shouting varletry 
Lay me stark-nak'd, and let the water-flies 
And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen, 
CLEOPATRA. His face was as the heav'ns, and therein stuck 
The little O, the earth. 
CLEOPATRA. His legs bestrid the ocean; his rear'd arm 
Crested the world. His voice was propertied 
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends; 
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, 
That grew the more by reaping. His delights 
The element they liv'd in. In his livery 
CLEOPATRA. You lie, up to the hearing of the gods. 
It's past the size of drearning. Nature wants stuff 
As answering to the weight. Would I might never 
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites 
CAESAR. Which is the Queen of Egypt? 
DOLABELLA. It is the Emperor, madam. [CLEOPATPA kneels] 
CLEOPATRA. Sir, the gods 
The record of what injuries you did us, 
CLEOPATRA. Sole sir o' th' world, 
CLEOPATRA. And may, through all the world. 'Tis yours, and we, 
CLEOPATRA. This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels, 
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus. 
Your wisdom in the deed. 
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does 
Doing the honour of thy lordliness 
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by 
With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me 
Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee go hence; 
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits 
Through th' ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man, 
CLEOPATRA. Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought 
Put we i' th' roll of conquest. Still be't yours, 
IRAS. Finish, good lady; the bright day is done, 
And we are for the dark. 
Go put it to the haste. 
DOLABELLA. Where's the Queen? 
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths, 
IRAS. The gods forbid! 
Ballad us out o' tune; the quick comedians 
I' th' posture of a whore. 
IRAS. O the good gods! 
CLEOPATRA. Why, that's the way

she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt- truly she makes 
a very good report o' th' worm. But he that will believe all that

More free from peril than the envious court? 
Here feel we not the penalty of Adam, 
The seasons' difference; as the icy fang 
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind, 
Sweet are the uses of adversity, 
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, 
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, 
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune 
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, 
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that; 
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood! 
To the which place a poor sequest'red stag, 
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt, 
The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans 
Almost to bursting; and the big round tears 
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool, 
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, 
Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brook,

JAQUES. A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' th' forest, 
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun, 
Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags; 
The motley fool thus moral on the time, 
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear. 
They have the gift to know it; and in his brain, 
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit 
With observation, the which he vents 
Withal, as large a charter as the wind, 
The why is plain as way to parish church: 
Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not, 
The wise man's folly is anatomiz'd 
Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool. 
Cleanse the foul body of th' infected world, 
As sensual as the brutish sting itself; 
And all th' embossed sores and headed evils 
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world. 
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, 
Till that the wearer's very means do ebb?

When that I say the city-woman bears 
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders? 
His folly to the mettle of my speech? 
ORLANDO. You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point 
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show

In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.

And all the men and women merely players; 
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, 
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms; 
Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel 
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, 
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, 
Seeking the bubble reputation 
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, 
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts 
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, 
Heigh-ho! sing heigh-ho! unto the green holly.

And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow, 
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring, 
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust; 
I do digest the poison of thy flesh, 
LUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang'd with you! 
What is the course and drift of your compact? 
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart. 
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy. 
LUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner. 
This is the fairy land. O spite of spites! 
To put the finger in the eye and weep, 
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate. 
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS 
To see the making of her carcanet, 
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him, 
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show; 
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink, 
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear. 
Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch. 
When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door. 
My master stays in the street. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door! 
from the house I owe? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] The porter for this time, 
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame. 
LUCE. [Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at the gate? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, knock the door hard. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You'll cry for this, minion, if beat the door down. 
LUCE. [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town? 
ADRIANA. [Within] Who is that at the door, that keeps all this noise? 
ADRIANA. [Within] Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the door. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in. 
Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold; 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I'll break ope the gate. 
And draw within the compass of suspect 
Th' unviolated honour of your wife. 
Why at this time the doors are made against you. 
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner; 
To know the reason of this strange restraint. 
Now in the stirring passage of the day, 
And that supposed by the common rout 
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made. 
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine; 
For there's the house. That chain will I bestow-

Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot? 
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint; 
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; 
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

She had transform'd me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i' th' wheel.

An if the wind blow any way from shore, 
If any bark put forth, come to the mart, 
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song. 
Enter ANGELO with the chain 
ANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain. 
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine; 
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long. 
And then receive my money for the chain. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now, 
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts. 
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;

SECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due, 
ANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you 
And in the instant that I met with you 
I shall receive the money for the same. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS, from the COURTEZAN'S 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou 
But, soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone; 
I promised your presence and the chain; 
ANGELO. Saving your merry humour, here's the note 
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, 
The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion, 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish'd with the present money; 
Besides, I have some business in the town. 
Good signior, take the stranger to my house, 
And with you take the chain, and bid my wife 
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof. 
ANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself? 
ANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you? 
ANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain; 
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine; 
SECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch. 
Either send the chain or send by me some token. 
Come, where's the chain? I pray you let me see it. 
If not, I'll leave him to the officer. 
ANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain. 
OFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke's name to obey me. 
OFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit. 
As all the metal in your shop will answer. 
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bay 
The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx. 
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope; 
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark. 
Give her this key, and tell her in the desk 
Tell her I am arrested in the street, 
The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS 
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away; 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the purse. Sweet 
The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands; 
One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell. 
ADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter; he is rested on the case. 
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk? 
ADRIANA. What, the chain? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; 'tis time that I were gone. 
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one. 
ADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear. 
If 'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way, 
ADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there's the money; bear it straight, 
The mart 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here's the gold you sent me 
for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell'd? 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise, 
but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the 
calf's skin that was kill'd for the Prodigal; he that came behind 
went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band; 
hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and 
then were you hind'red by the sergeant, to tarry for the 
boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I; 
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now. 
Is that the chain you promis'd me to-day? 
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's 
dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and 
thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me!' That's 
that must eat with the devil. 
COURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner, 
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis'd, 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, 
The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it. 
COURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain; 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. 'Fly pride' says the peacock. Mistress, that you know. 
And for the same he promis'd me a chain; 
The reason that I gather he is mad, 
On purpose shut the doors against his way. 
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER 
And will not lightly trust the messenger. 
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where's the money? 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.

I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven. 
Did this companion with the saffron face 
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut, 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you. 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence? 
That since have felt the vigour of his rage. 
PINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein, 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me. 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness 
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold? 
PINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him. 
The debt he owes will be requir'd of me. 
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it. 
Be mad, good master; cry 'The devil!' 
ADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes? 
The ring I saw upon his finger now- 
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is; 
I long to know the truth hereof at large.

But I protest he had the chain of me, 
SECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem'd here in the city? 
Second to none that lives here in the city; 
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment, 
Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and OTHERS 
<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory 
Enter the LADY ABBESS 
ABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man? 
And much different from the man he was; 
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing. 
ADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last; 
ADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference. 
Alone, it was the subject of my theme; 
ABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad. 
The venom clamours of a jealous woman 
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred; 
The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits 
Hath scar'd thy husband from the use of wits. 
Till I have us'd the approved means I have, 
To separate the husband and the wife. 
LUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity. 
And take perforce my husband from the Abbess. 
SECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five; 
Anon, I'm sure, the Duke himself in person 
Comes this way to the melancholy vale, 
The place of death and sorry execution, 
Behind the ditches of the abbey here. 
Against the laws and statutes of this town, 
LUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey. 
Enter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded; 
with the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS 
If any friend will pay the sum for him, 
ADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess! 
That desp'rately he hurried through the street, 
Doing displeasure to the citizens 
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence 
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went, 
He broke from those that had the guard of him, 
And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us, 
To do him all the grace and good I could. 
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate, 
And bid the Lady Abbess come to me, 
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor, 
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair. 
My master preaches patience to him, and the while 
Between them they will kill the conjurer. 
Even now we hous'd him in the abbey here, 
Even for the service that long since I did thee, 
When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took 
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood 
AEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote, 
Even in the strength and height of injury. 
Beyond imagination is the wrong 
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me, 
In this the madman justly chargeth them. 
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine, 
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine, 
I went to seek him. In the street I met him, 
That I this day of him receiv'd the chain, 
Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which 
Then fairly I bespoke the officer 
By th' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more 
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence, 
These people saw the chain about his neck. 
Heard you confess you had the chain of him, 
After you first forswore it on the mart; 
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven! 
You say he din'd at home: the goldsmith here 
DROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din'd with her there, at the Porpentine. 
DUKE. Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here? 
DUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the Abbess hither. 
<Exit one to the ABBESS 
And pay the sum that may deliver me. 
And all the conduits of my blood froze up, 
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in 
the city Can witness with me that it is not so: 
Re-enter the ABBESS, with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
DUKE. One of these men is genius to the other; 
And so of these. Which is the natural man, 
And which the spirit? Who deciphers them? 
Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be'st the man 
O, if thou be'st the same Aegeon, speak, 
And speak unto the same Aemilia! 
That floated with thee on the fatal raft? 
And the twin Dromio, all were taken up; 
These are the parents to these children, 
ANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me. 
ABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains 
To go with us into the abbey here, 
The Duke, my husband, and my children both, 
And you the calendars of their nativity, 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur. 
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE. We'll draw cuts for the senior; till then, 
We came into the world like brother and brother,

Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-

That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, 
That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you, 
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you, 
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice

Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe 
Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows

So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds;

Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste

Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;

Near the camp of COMINIUS 
The charges of our friends. The Roman gods, 
MESSENGER. The citizens of Corioli have issued 
MESSENGER. Spies of the Volsces 
He has the stamp of Marcius, and I have 
COMINIUS. The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor 
More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue 
COMINIUS. Ay, if you come not in the blood of others, 
Ransoming him or pitying, threat'ning th' other; 
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome 
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash, 
He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen, 
The common file- a plague! tribunes for them!

Where is the enemy? Are you lords o' th' field? 
Their bands i' th' vaward are the Antiates, 
By all the battles wherein we have fought, 
By th' blood we have shed together, by th' vows 
And that you not delay the present, but, 
Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts, 
Able to bear against the great Aufidius 
Though thanks to all, must I select from all; the rest 
Shall bear the business in some other fight, 
The gates of Corioli 
LARTIUS. So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties 
Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve 
For a short holding. If we lose the field 
We cannot keep the town. 
Our guider, come; to th' Roman camp conduct us. Exeunt 
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps 
MARCIUS. Let the first budger die the other's slave, 
And the gods doom him after! 
Wrench up thy power to th' highest.

That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny, 
Here they fight, and certain Volsces come in the aid 
The Roman camp 
COMINIUS with the Romans; at another door, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf 
I' th' end admire; where ladies shall be frighted 
And, gladly quak'd, hear more; where the dull tribunes, 
That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours, 
Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods 
Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit 
Here is the steed, we the caparison. 
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know 
The value of her own. 'Twere a concealment 
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd, 
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses- 
The treasure in this field achiev'd and city, 
We render you the tenth; to be ta'en forth 
Before the common distribution at 
That have beheld the doing.

Soft as the parasite's silk, let him be made

With all th' applause-and clamour of the host,

MESSENGER. You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought

COMINIUS. I shall lack voice; the deeds of Coriolanus 
That valour is the chiefest virtue and 
Most dignifies the haver. If it be, 
The man I speak of cannot in the world 
Beyond the mark of others; our then Dictator, 
The bristled lips before him; he bestrid

He prov'd best man i' th' field, and for his meed 
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age 
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since 
He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last, 
I cannot speak him home. He stopp'd the fliers, 
And by his rare example made the coward 
The mortal gate of th' city, which he painted 
When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce 
And to the battle came he; where he did 
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if

SEVENTH CITIZEN. Therefore let him be consul. The gods give him 
joy, and make him good friend to the people! 
MENENIUS. You have stood your limitation, and the tribunes 
Endue you with the people's voice. Remains 
That, in th' official marks invested, you 
Anon do meet the Senate.

The people do admit you, and are summon'd

Repair to th' Senate House.

BRUTUS. We pray the gods he may deserve your loves. 
But was a petty servant to the state, 
Your liberties and the charters that you bear 
I' th' body of the weal; and now, arriving 
A place of potency and sway o' th' state, 
Fast foe to th' plebeii, your voices might 
You should have ta'en th' advantage of his choler 
Against the rectorship of judgment? 
Ere now denied the asker, and now again, 
With what contempt he wore the humble weed; 
Th' apprehension of his present portance, 
After the inveterate hate he bears you. 
Than what you should, made you against the grain 
To voice him consul. Lay the fault on us.

Of the same house Publius and Quintus were, 
Twice being by the people chosen censor,

SICINIUS. To th' Capitol, come. 
We will be there before the stream o' th' people;

CORIOLANUS. So then the Volsces stand but as at first, 
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely 
Yielded the town. He is retir'd to Antium. 
That of all things upon the earth he hated 
Behold, these are the tribunes of the people, 
The tongues o' th' common mouth. I do despise them, 
MENENIUS. The matter? 
COMINIUS. Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common? 
FIRST SENATOR. Tribunes, give way: he shall to th' market-place. 
BRUTUS. The people are incens'd against him. 
To curb the will of the nobility; 
The people cry you mock'd them; and of late, 
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them 
For which the people stir; if you will pass 
COMINIUS. The people are abus'd; set on. This palt'ring 
I' th' plain way of his merit. 
For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them 
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, 
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number, 
The very way to catch them. 
BRUTUS. You speak o' th' people 
We let the people know't. 
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, 
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you 
COMINIUS. 'Twas from the canon. 
The horn and noise o' th' monster's, wants not spirit 
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste 
It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches 
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take 
The one by th' other. 
COMINIUS. Well, on to th' market-place. 
The corn o' th' storehouse gratis, as 'twas us'd 
CORIOLANUS. Though there the people had more absolute pow'r- 
The ruin of the state. 
BRUTUS. Why shall the people give 
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn 
They ne'er did service for't; being press'd to th' war 
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd, 
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service 
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' th' war, 
Most valour, spoke not for them. Th' accusation 
Which they have often made against the Senate, 
All cause unborn, could never be the native 
The Senate's courtesy? Let deeds express 
We are the greater poll, and in true fear 
The nature of our seats, and make the rabble 
Break ope the locks o' th' Senate and bring in 
The crows to peck the eagles. 
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other 
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no 
Real necessities, and give way the while 
That love the fundamental part of state 
More than you doubt the change on't; that prefer 
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick 
The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonour 
Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state 
Not having the power to do the good it would, 
For th' ill which doth control't. 
What should the people do with these bald tribunes, 
To the greater bench? In a rebellion, 
And throw their power i' th' dust. 
BRUTUS. The aediles, ho! 
SICINIUS. Go call the people, [Exit AEDILE] in whose name myself 
A foe to th' public weal. Obey, I charge thee, 
Enter a rabble of plebeians, with the AEDILES 
To th' people- Coriolanus, patience! 
This is the way to kindle, not to quench. 
FIRST SENATOR. To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat. 
SICINIUS. What is the city but the people? 
The people are the city. 
BRUTUS. By the consent of all we were establish'd 
The people's magistrates. 
COMINIUS. That is the way to lay the city flat, 
To bring the roof to the foundation, 
Upon the part o' th' people, in whose power 
Bear him to th' rock Tarpeian, and from thence 
Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him 
And bear him to the rock. 
[In this mutiny the TRIBUNES, the AEDILES, 
and the people are beat in]

Though calved i' th' porch o' th' Capitol. 
Take up a brace o' th' best of them; yea, the two tribunes. 
Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend

He heard the name of death. [A noise within] 
What the vengeance, could he not speak 'em fair?

That would depopulate the city and 
SICINIUS. He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock

The which shall turn you to no further harm

Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost- 
A brand to th' end o' th' world.

Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence, 
The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will, too late,

It is the humane way; the other course 
Will prove too bloody, and the end of it 
Unknown to the beginning.

MENENIUS. Return to th' tribunes. 
CORIOLANUS. For them! I cannot do it to the gods; 
I' th' war do grow together; grant that, and tell me 
In peace what each of them by th' other lose 
The same you are not, which for your best ends 
To th' people, not by your own instruction, 
Nor by th' matter which your heart prompts you, 
The hazard of much blood.

For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard 
Not what is dangerous present, but the los

Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th' ignorant 
More learned than the ears- waving thy head, 
Now humble as the ripest mulberry 
That will not hold the handling. Or say to them 
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess, 
COMINIUS. I have been i' th' market-place; and, sir, 'tis fit 
And throw't against the wind. To th' market-place! 
I shall discharge to th' life.

That babies lulls asleep! The smiles of knaves

Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.

And power i' th' truth o' th' cause.

If you submit you to the people's voices, 
The warlike service he has done, consider; think 
Upon the wounds his body bears, which show 
Like graves i' th' holy churchyard. 
CORIOLANUS. What is the matter, 
I am so dishonour'd that the very hour 
For which you are a traitor to the people. 
CORIOLANUS. The fires i' th' lowest hell fold in the people! 
As I do pray the gods. 
PLEBEIANS. To th' rock, to th' rock, with him!

MENENIUS. Is this the promise that you made your mother? 
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death, 
Their mercy at the price of one fair word, 
Envied against the people, seeking means 
Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence 
Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers 
That do distribute it- in the name o' th' people, 
And in the power of us the tribunes, we, 
From off the rock Tarpeian, never more 
To enter our Rome gates. I' th' people's name, 
As enemy to the people and his country. 
As reek o' th' rotten fens, whose loves I prize 
As the dead carcasses of unburied men 
Fan you into despair! Have the power still 
For you the city, thus I turn my back;

And when a soldier was the theme, my name 
I was confederate with the Romans. So 
The fore-end of my time. But up to th' mountains! 
The venison first shall be the lord o' th' feast; 
To him the other two shall minister; 
In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys. 
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature! 
These boys know little they are sons to th' King, 
I' th' cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit 
The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them 
Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore, 
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who 
The King his father call'd Guiderius- Jove! 
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out 
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats, 
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal, 
His own conceiving. Hark, the game is rous'd! 
They take for natural father. The game is up. Exit 
IMOGEN. Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place 
From th' inward of thee? One but painted thus 
Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter? 
The most disdain'd of fortune. 
IMOGEN. [Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play'd the strumpet in 
my bed, the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me. I speak not 
for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let 
at Milford Haven; she hath my letter for the purpose; where, if 
the pander to her dishonour, and equally to me disloyal.' 
PISANIO. What shall I need to draw my sword? The paper 
Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue 
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath 
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie 
All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states, 
Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave, 
And for I am richer than to hang by th' walls 
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men: 
I draw the sword myself; take it, and hit 
The innocent mansion of my love, my heart. 
The riches of it. Do his bidding; strike. 
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here? 
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus 
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor 
That didst set up my disobedience 'gainst the King 
My father, and make me put into contempt the suits 
The lamp entreats the butcher. Where's thy knife? 
The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court, 
Th' elected deer before thee? 
To lose so bad employment, in the which 
What shall I do the while? where bide? how live? 
PISANIO. If you'll back to th' court- 
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night, 
Are they not but in Britain? I' th' world's volume 
You think of other place. Th' ambassador, 
LUCIUS the Roman, comes to Milford Haven 
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least, 
PISANIO. Well then, here's the point: 
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly, 
As quarrelous as the weasel. Nay, you must 
Exposing it- but, O, the harder heart! 
Alack, no remedy!- to the greedy touch 
IMOGEN. Thou art all the comfort 
The gods will diet me with. Prithee away! 
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress, 
Here is a box; I had it from the Queen. 
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods 
Direct you to the best! 
The due of honour in no point omit. 
LUCIUS. Sir, the event 
Is yet to name the winner. Fare you well. 
CYMBELINE. Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords, 
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness! 
CLOTEN. 'Tis all the better; 
CYMBELINE. Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor 
The pow'rs that he already hath in Gallia 
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd 
The duty of the day. She looks us like 
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retir'd 
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord, 
That will be given to th' loud of noise we make. 
QUEEN. Son, I say, follow the King. 
I have the placing of the British crown. 
Go in and cheer the King. He rages; none 
QUEEN. All the better. May 
This night forestall him of the coming day! Exit

Be those the garments? 
CLOTEN. Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second thing 
that I have commanded thee. The third is that thou wilt be a

Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick 
When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee, 
Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean, 
Thou art one o' th' false ones. Now I think on thee 
But fear the sword, like me, he'll scarcely look on't. 
Such a foe, good heavens! Exit into the cave 
Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I 
Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match. 
The sweat of industry would dry and die 
But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs 
Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth 
Finds the down pillow hard. Now, peace be here, 
GUIDERIUS. There is cold meat i' th' cave; we'll browse on that 
BELARIUS. [Looking into the cave] Stay, come not in. 
GUIDERIUS. What's the matter, sir? 
Gold strew'd i' th' floor. Here's money for my meat. 
I would have left it on the board, so soon 
With pray'rs for the provider. 
That did attend themselves, and had the virtue

FIRST SENATOR. This is the tenour of the Emperor's writ: 
That since the common men are now in action 
'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians, 
And that the legions now in Gallia are 
The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite 
The gentry to this business. He creates

Must be supplyant. The words of your commission 
Will tie you to the numbers and the time

CLOTEN. I am near to th' place where they should meet, if Pisanio

description of their meeting-place; and the fellow dares not 
Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS 
Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN 
BELARIUS. [To IMOGEN] You are not well. Remain here in the cave; 
Stick to your journal course. The breach of custom 
How much the quantity, the weight as much 
Love's reason's without reason. The bier at door, 
'Tis the ninth hour o' th' morn. 
Th' imperious seas breed monsters; for the dish, 
BELARIUS. To th' field, to th' field! 
BELARIUS. And shalt be ever. Exit IMOGEN into the cave 
A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh 
The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly 
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine 
His perishing root with the increasing vine! 
Cloten, the son o' th' Queen. I fear some ambush. 
The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool; 
I am son to th' Queen. 
GUIDERIUS. Those that I reverence, those I fear- the wise: 
CLOTEN. Die the death. 
And on the gates of Lud's Town set your heads. 
ARVIRAGUS. None in the world; you did mistake him, sure. 
Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice, 
Is oft the cease of fear. 
Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne 
Son to the Queen, after his own report; 
Displace our heads where- thank the gods!- they grow, 
But that he swore to take, our lives? The law 
For we do fear the law? What company 
May make some stronger head- the which he hearing, 
More perilous than the head. 
Come as the gods foresay it. Howsoe'er, 
To hunt this day; the boy Fidele's sickness 
His head from him. I'll throw't into the creek 
Behind our rock, and let it to the sea 
And tell the fishes he's the Queen's son, Cloten. 
So the revenge alone pursu'd me! Polydore, 
You and Fidele play the cooks; I'll stay 
As zephyrs blowing below the violet, 
Their royal blood enchaf'd, as the rud'st wind 
That by the top doth take the mountain pine 
And make him stoop to th' vale. 'Tis wonder 
I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream, 
Should answer solemn accidents. The matter? 
And brings the dire occasion in his arms 
ARVIRAGUS. The bird is dead 
My brother wears thee not the one half so well 
The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare 
ARVIRAGUS. O' th' floor; 
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose; nor 
The azur'd hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor 
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander, 
Out-sweet'ned not thy breath. The ruddock would, 
Is now due debt. To th' grave. 
Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th' ground, 
BELARIUS. Great griefs, I see, med'cine the less, for Cloten 
That angel of the world- doth make distinction 
We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin. 
GUIDERIUS. Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th' East; 
GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the heat o' th' sun 
Nor the furious winter's rages; 
ARVIRAGUS. Fear no more the frown o' th' great; 
Thou art past the tyrant's stroke. 
To thee the reed is as the oak. 
The sceptre, learning, physic, must 
GUIDERIUS. Fear no more the lightning flash, 
ARVIRAGUS. Nor th' all-dreaded thunder-stone; 
Re-enter BELARIUS with the body of CLOTEN 
The herbs that have on them cold dew o' th' night 
The ground that gave them first has them again. 
IMOGEN. [Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford Haven. Which is the way? 
[Seeing the body] 
These flow'rs are like the pleasures of the world; 
This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream; 
Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes 
The dream's here still. Even when I wake it is 
A headless man? The garments of Posthumus? 
I know the shape of's leg; this is his hand, 
The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face- 
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks, 
From this most bravest vessel of the world 
Struck the main-top. O Posthumus! alas, 
Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart, 
The drug he gave me, which he said was precious 
Murd'rous to th' senses? That confirms it home. 
That we the horrider may seem to those

After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending

Under the conduct of bold Iachimo, 
CAPTAIN. With the next benefit o' th' wind. 
Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir, 
SOOTHSAYER. Last night the very gods show'd me a vision- 
I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd 
From the spongy south to this part of the west, 
There vanish'd in the sunbeams; which portends, 
Success to th' Roman host. 
Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime 
With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead. 
Let's see the boy's face. 
No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope 
LUCIUS. Thou dost approve thyself the very same; 
No less belov'd. The Roman Emperor's letters, 
IMOGEN. I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods, 
I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep 
The boy hath taught us manly duties; let us 
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can, 
Some falls are means the happier to arise. Exeunt 
A fever with the absence of her son; 
The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen 
The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow, 
The day that she was missing he was here. 
CYMBELINE. The time is troublesome. 
The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn, 
Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent. 
CYMBELINE. Now for the counsel of my son and queen! 
The want is but to put those pow'rs in motion 
And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not 
Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work. 
Even to the note o' th' King, or I'll fall in them. 
Wales. Before the cave of BELARIUS 
GUIDERIUS. The noise is round about us. 
Have we in hiding us? This way the Romans 
We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us. 
To the King's party there's no going. Newness 
Among the bands-may drive us to a render 
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh, 
Of many in the army. Many years, 
From my remembrance. And, besides, the King 
Who find in my exile the want of breeding, 
The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless 
To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd, 
The shrinking slaves of winter. 
Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th' army. 
To look upon the holy sun, to have 
The benefit of his blest beams, remaining 
I'll take the better care; but if you will not, 
The hazard therefore due fall on me by 
The hands of Romans!

Ber. Long live the King! 
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste. 
Mar. And liegemen to the Dane. 
With us to watch the minutes of this night, 
When yond same star that's westward from the pole 
The bell then beating one- 
Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead. 
Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio. 
In which the majesty of buried Denmark 
Without the sensible and true avouch 
Mar. Is it not like the King? 
Such was the very armour he had on 
When he th' ambitious Norway combated. 
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 
But, in the gross and scope of my opinion, 
So nightly toils the subject of the land, 
Does not divide the Sunday from the week. 
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day? 
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, 
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet 
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror; 
Against the which a moiety competent 
To the inheritance of Fortinbras, 
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart 
And carriage of the article design'd, 
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there, 
Is the main motive of our preparations, 
The source of this our watch, and the chief head 
Of this post-haste and romage in the land. 
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King 
That was and is the question of these wars. 
Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. 
In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, 
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead 
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets; 
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star 
And even the like precurse of fierce events, 
As harbingers preceding still the fates 
And prologue to the omen coming on, 
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth 
The cock crows. 
To offer it the show of violence; 
For it is as the air, invulnerable, 
Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew. 
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, 
Awake the god of day; and at his warning, 
Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies 
To his confine; and of the truth herein 
Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock. 
The bird of dawning singeth all night long; 
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike, 
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. 
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, 
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill. 
Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle. 
Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, 
The memory be green, and that it us befitted 
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state, 
Importing the surrender of those lands 
Thus much the business is: we have here writ 
His further gait herein, in that the levies, 
The lists, and full proportions are all made 
To business with the King, more than the scope 
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? 
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane 
The head is not more native to the heart, 
The hand more instrumental to the mouth, 
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. 
King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you? 
Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun. 
Seek for thy noble father in the dust. 
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, 
Nor the dejected havior of the visage, 
These but the trappings and the suits of woe. 
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound 
As any the most vulgar thing to sense, 
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, 
From the first corse till he that died to-day, 
As of a father; for let the world take note 
You are the most immediate to our throne, 
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye, 
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, 
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, 
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd 
Seem to me all the uses of this world! 
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven 
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears 
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, 
Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever. 
Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats 
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. 
Hor. My lord, the King your father. 
Ham. The King my father? 
Upon the witness of these gentlemen, 
In the dead vast and middle of the night 
Almost to jelly with the act of fear, 
And I with them the third night kept the watch; 
Form of the thing, each word made true and good, 
The apparition comes. I knew your father. 
Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd. 
But even then the morning cock crew loud, 
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away 
Hold you the watch to-night? 
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, 
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come! 
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. 
Elsinore. A room in the house of Polonius. 
And, sister, as the winds give benefit 
Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour, 
A violet in the youth of primy nature, 
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; 
The inward service of the mind and soul 
The virtue of his will; but you must fear, 
The safety and health of this whole state, 
Unto the voice and yielding of that body 
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, 
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. 
And keep you in the rear of your affection, 
Out of the shot and danger of desire. 
The chariest maid is prodigal enough 
If she unmask her beauty to the moon. 
The canker galls the infants of the spring 
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth 
Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep 
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, 
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads 
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, 
Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. 
For the apparel oft proclaims the man, 
And they in France of the best rank and station 
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. 
And it must follow, as the night the day, 
Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend. 
And you yourself shall keep the key of it. 
Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet. 
What is between you? Give me up the truth. 
Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, 
With almost all the holy vows of heaven. 
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul 
Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter, 
The better to beguile. This is for all: 
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. 
Elsinore. The platform before the Castle. 
Ham. The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold. 
Hor. Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season 
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. 
Ham. The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, 
Keeps wassail, and the swagg'ring upspring reels, 
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out 
The triumph of his pledge. 
And to the manner born, it is a custom 
More honour'd in the breach than the observance. 
The pith and marrow of our attribute. 
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, 
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, 
The form of plausive manners, that these men 
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, 
Shall in the general censure take corruption 
From that particular fault. The dram of e'il 
Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal. 
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre 
Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, 
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? 
Ham. Why, what should be the fear? 
Hor. What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, 
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff 
That beetles o'er his base into the sea, 
The very place puts toys of desperation, 
That looks so many fadoms to the sea 
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. 
Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark. 
Elsinore. The Castle. Another part of the fortifications. 
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, 
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires, 
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature 
To tell the secrets of my prison house, 
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine. 
Ghost. Murther most foul, as in the best it is; 
As meditation or the thoughts of love, 
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed 
A serpent stung me. So the whole ear of Denmark 
The serpent that did sting thy father's life 
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power 
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen. 
That it went hand in hand even with the vow 
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air. 
My custom always of the afternoon, 
And in the porches of my ears did pour 
The leperous distilment; whose effect 
The natural gates and alleys of the body, 
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine; 
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, 
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be 
The glowworm shows the matin to be near 
Yea, from the table of my memory 
Within the book and volume of my brain, 
Hor. There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave 
Ham. Why, right! You are in the right! 
Ghost cries under the stage. 
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage. 
Hor. Propose the oath, my lord. 
Ham. Well said, old mole! Canst work i' th' earth so fast? 
The time is out of joint. O cursed spite

Speaker of the Epilogue 
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks? 
I, from the orient to the drooping west, 
Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold 
The acts commenced on this ball of earth. 
The which in every language I pronounce, 
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports. 
Under the smile of safety, wounds the world; 
Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief, 
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war, 
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads, 
The still-discordant wav'ring multitude, 
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion 
Even with the rebels' blood. But what mean I 
Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword, 
And that the King before the Douglas' rage

LORD BARDOLPH. Who keeps the gate here, ho? 
The PORTER opens the gate 
Where is the Earl? 
LORD BARDOLPH. Tell thou the Earl 
That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here. 
PORTER. His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard. 
Please it your honour knock but at the gate, 
LORD BARDOLPH. Here comes the Earl. Exit PORTER 
Should be the father of some stratagem. 
The times are wild; contention, like a horse 
The King is almost wounded to the death; 
And, in the fortune of my lord your son, 
Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts 
Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John, 
And Westmoreland, and Stafford, fled the field; 
And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John, 
Came not till now to dignify the times, 
Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury? 
LORD BARDOLPH. I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence; 
LORD BARDOLPH. My lord, I over-rode him on the way; 
He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him 
With that he gave his able horse the head 
Against the panting sides of his poor jade 
Up to the rowel-head; and starting so, 
He seem'd in running to devour the way, 
If my young lord your son have not the day, 
The horse he rode on and, upon my life, 
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume. 
So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood 
Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek 
Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night 
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue, 
Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas'- 
But in the end, to stop my ear indeed, 
He that but fears the thing he would not know 
The tongue offends not that reports his death; 
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, 
Not he which says the dead is not alive. 
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news 
The never-daunted Percy to the earth, 
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp- 
From the best-temper'd courage in his troops; 
Which once in him abated, an the rest 
And as the thing that's heavy in itself 
Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester 
The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword 
Had three times slain th' appearance of the King, 
Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame 
Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all 
Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out 
Under the conduct of young Lancaster 
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full. 
And as the wretch whose fever-weak'ned joints, 
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head 
The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring 
To frown upon th' enrag'd Northumberland! 
Keep the wild flood confin'd! Let order die! 
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain 
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end 
And darkness be the burier of the dead! 
The lives of all your loving complices 
Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er 
You cast th' event of war, my noble lord, 
And summ'd the account of chance before you said 
That in the dole of blows your son might drop. 
The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall'n, 
And yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd 
Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd; 
I hear for certain, and dare speak the truth: 
The gentle Archbishop of York is up 
My lord your son had only but the corpse, 
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight; 
The action of their bodies from their souls; 
As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop

The aptest way for safety and revenge.

The substance of my speech. If that rebellion

And purge th' obstructions which begin to stop

And have the summary of all our griefs,

To all the Duke of Norfolk's signiories, 
The King that lov'd him, as the state stood then, 
Their neighing coursers daring of the spur, 
And the loud trumpet blowing them together- 
My father from the breast of Bolingbroke, 
O, when the King did throw his warder down- 
His own life hung upon the staff he threw- 
The Earl of Hereford was reputed then 
In England the most valiant gentleman.

KING. Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow? 
KING. The Prince hath ta'en it hence. Go, seek him out.

Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.

Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse 
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms. 
Harry the Fifth is crown'd. Up, vanity: 
And to the English court assemble now, 
Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit 
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways? 
For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks 
The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog 
The moist impediments unto my speech, 
The course of it so far. There is your crown, 
And he that wears the crown immortally 
And never live to show th' incredulous world 
The noble change that I have purposed! 
And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending 
Hath fed upon the body of my father; 
The quarrel of a true inheritor.

Give entertainment to the might of it, 
And make me as the poorest vassal is,

With me into the earth. It seem'd in me 
Changes the mood; for what in me was purchas'd

To be the realm of France, and Pharamond

That the land Salique is in Germany, 
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe; 
Where Charles the Great, having subdu'd the Saxons, 
Who, holding in disdain the German women 
Then doth it well appear the Salique law 
Was not devised for the realm of France; 
Nor did the French possess the Salique land 
Idly suppos'd the founder of this law; 
Who died within the year of our redemption

The blood and courage that renowned them 
Is in the very May-morn of his youth, 
EXETER. Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth 
As did the former lions of your blood. 
And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France. 
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty 
As never did the clergy at one time 
KING HENRY. We must not only arm t' invade the French, 
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us 
Our inland from the pilfering borderers. 
KING HENRY. We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, 
But fear the main intendment of the Scot, 
But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom 
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach, 
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays, 
Hath shook and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood. 
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France, 
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea 
For once the eagle England being in prey, 
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot 
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, 
EXETER. It follows, then, the cat must stay at home; 
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves. 
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad, 
Th' advised head defends itself at home; 
The state of man in divers functions, 
Obedience; for so work the honey bees, 
The act of order to a peopled kingdom. 
Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds, 
To the tent-royal of their emperor; 
The singing masons building roofs of gold, 
The civil citizens kneading up the honey, 
The poor mechanic porters crowding in 
The sad-ey'd justice, with his surly hum, 
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer, 
As many lines close in the dial's centre; 
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, 
The name of hardiness and policy. 
KING HENRY. Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin. 
And yours, the noble sinews of our power, 
Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure 
Your greeting is from him, not from the King. 
The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy? 
Tell us the Dauphin's mind. 
Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right 
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third. 
In answer of which claim, the Prince our master 
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim 
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks. 
KING HENRY. We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us; 
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard. 
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd 
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state, 
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France, 
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us. 
And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his 
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance 
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn. 
But this lies all within the will of God, 
Tell you the Dauphin, I am coming on, 
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin 
KING HENRY. We hope to make the sender blush at it.

CHORUS. Now all the youth of England are on fire, 
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies; 
Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought 
Reigns solely in the breast of every man; 
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse, 
Following the mirror of all Christian kings 
For now sits Expectation in the air, 
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point 
The French, advis'd by good intelligence 
Seek to divert the English purposes. 
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second, 
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third, 
Have, for the gilt of France- O guilt indeed!- 
Th' abuse of distance, force a play. 
The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed, 
The King is set from London, and the scene 
There is the play-house now, there must you sit, 
And thence to France shall we convey you safe 
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas 
But, till the King come forth, and not till then,

That is the word. I thee defy again. 
No; to the spital go, 
And from the powd'ring tub of infamy 
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,

For the only she; and- pauca, there's enough. 
Enter the Boy

HOSTESS. By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of these 
days: the King has kill'd his heart. Good husband, come home 
together; why the devil should we keep knives to cut one 
NYM. You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting? 
PISTOL. Base is the slave that pays. 
NYM. That now I will have; that's the humour of it. 
BARDOLPH. By this sword, he that makes the first thrust I'll kill

EXETER. Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow, 
Trumpets sound. Enter the KING, SCROOP, 
KING HENRY. Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard. 
Think you not that the pow'rs we bear with us 
Will cut their passage through the force of France, 
Doing the execution and the act 
Under the sweet shade of your government. 
And shall forget the office of our hand 
According to the weight and worthiness. 
Enlarge the man committed yesterday 
After the taste of much correction. 
Who are the late commissioners? 
KING HENRY. The mercy that was quick in us but late 
And sworn unto the practices of France 
To kill us here in Hampton; to the which 
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels, 
That knew'st the very bottom of my soul, 
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross 
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence; 
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor. 
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world, 
And tell the legions 'I can never win 
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful? 
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood, 
Not working with the eye without the ear, 
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued

At the discovery of most dangerous treason

Let senses rule. The word is 'Pitch and Pay.' 
And Holdfast is the only dog, my duck. 
To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck. 
NYM. I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but adieu. 
France. The KING'S palace 
Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the DUKES OF BERRI

FRENCH KING. Thus comes the English with full power upon us; 
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britaine, 
As waters to the sucking of a gulf. 
Left by the fatal and neglected English 
It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe; 
To view the sick and feeble parts of France; 
Question your Grace the late ambassadors 
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus, 
The enemy more mighty than he seems; 
So the proportions of defence are fill'd; 
The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us; 
And all our princes capdv'd by the hand 
Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun- 
Mangle the work of nature, and deface 
The patterns that by God and by French fathers

Take up the English short, and let them know 
Of what a monarchy you are the head. 
He wills you, in the name of God Almighty, 
The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven, 
To him and to his heirs- namely, the crown, 
By custom and the ordinance of times, 
Unto the crown of France. That you may know 
Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days, 
Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd, 
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign 
From him, the native and true challenger.

And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord, 
Deliver up the crown; and to take mercy 
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war 
Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries, 
The dead men's blood, the privy maidens' groans,

Alarum. Enter the KING, EXETER, BEDFORD, GLOUCESTER, 
KING. Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more; 
Or close the wall up with our English dead. 
But when the blast of war blows in our ears, 
Then imitate the action of the tiger: 
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, 
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect; 
Let it pry through the portage of the head 
Like the brass cannon: let the brow o'erwhelm it 
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean. 
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide; 
Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit 
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear 
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, 
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot: 
BARDOLPH. On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach! 
NYM. Pray thee, Corporal, stay; the knocks are too hot, and for 
mine own part I have not a case of lives. The humour of it is too 
hot; that is the very plain-song of it. 
PISTOL. The plain-song is most just; for humours do abound: 
FLUELLEN. Up to the breach, you dogs! 
red-fac'd; by the means whereof 'a faces it out, but fights not. 
For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the

GOWER. Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the mines; the 
FLUELLEN. To the mines! Tell you the Duke it is not so good to come 
to the mines; for, look you, the mines is not according to the 
disciplines of the war; the concavities of it is not sufficient. 
For, look you, th' athversary- you may discuss unto the Duke, 
look you- is digt himself four yard under the countermines; by 
GOWER. The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the siege is 
FLUELLEN. By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will verify 
as much in his beard; he has no more directions in the true 
disciplines of the wars, look you, of the Roman disciplines, than 
GOWER. Here 'a comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with 
certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient 
he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the 
world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans. 
GOWER. How now, Captain Macmorris! Have you quit the mines? Have 
the pioneers given o'er? 
MACMORRIS. By Chrish, la, tish ill done! The work ish give over, 
the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I swear, and my 
father's soul, the work ish ill done; it ish give over; I would 
have blowed up the town, so Chrish save me, la, in an hour. O, 
concerning the disciplines of the war, the Roman wars, in the way

my mind, as touching the direction of the military discipline, 
that is the point. 
MACMORRIS. It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me. The day 
is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the King, and the 
Dukes; it is no time to discourse. The town is beseech'd, and the

Before the gates of Harfleur 
Enter the GOVERNOR and some citizens on the walls. Enter the KING

KING HENRY. How yet resolves the Governor of the town? 
This is the latest parle we will admit; 
If I begin the batt'ry once again, 
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur 
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up, 
And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart, 
Array'd in flames, like to the prince of fiends, 
If your pure maidens fall into the hand 
When down the hill he holds his fierce career? 
Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil, 
As send precepts to the Leviathan 
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace 
O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds 
The blind and bloody with foul hand 
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters; 
Your fathers taken by the silver beards, 
And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls; 
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd 
Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry 
The Dauphin, whom of succours we entreated, 
And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French; 
The winter coming on, and sickness growing 
To-morrow for the march are we addrest.

FRENCH KING. Where is Montjoy the herald? Speed him hence; 
More sharper than your swords, hie to the field: 
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.

The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon;

GOWER. Is the Duke of Exeter safe? 
FLUELLEN. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon; and a 
not- God be praised and blessed!- any hurt in the world, but 
keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There 
is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge- I think in my 
man of no estimation in the world; but I did see him do as 
FLUELLEN. Here is the man. 
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well. 
That stands upon the rolling restless stone- 
signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning,

But Exeter hath given the doom of death 
Therefore, go speak- the Duke will hear thy voice;

KING HENRY. How now, Fluellen! Cam'st thou from the bridge? 
FLUELLEN. Ay, so please your Majesty. The Duke of Exeter has very 
gallantly maintain'd the pridge; the French is gone off, look 
you, and there is gallant and most prave passages. Marry, th' 
athversary was have possession of the pridge; but he is enforced 
to retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge; I can 
tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave man.

Enter the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE, the LORD RAMBURES, the DUKE OF ORLEANS,

CONSTABLE. Tut! I have the best armour of the world. 
CONSTABLE. It is the best horse of Europe. 
ORLEANS. You are as well provided of both as any prince in the 
any that treads but on four pasterns. Ca, ha! he bounds from the 
earth as if his entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the 
am a hawk. He trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it; 
the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of 
ORLEANS. He's of the colour of the nutmeg. 
DAUPHIN. And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus: 
he is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water 
DAUPHIN. It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the 
DAUPHIN. Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of 
the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserved praise on my 
palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea: turn the sands into 
sovereign to ride on; and for the world- familiar to us and 
DAUPHIN. Me well; which is the prescript praise and perfection of a 
proverb so little kin to the purpose. 
RAMBURES. My Lord Constable, the armour that I saw in your tent 
way; but I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the 
ears of the English. 
ORLEANS. The Dauphin longs for morning. 
RAMBURES. He longs to eat the English. 
ORLEANS. By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince. 
CONSTABLE. Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath. 
ORLEANS. He is simply the most active gentleman of France. 
ORLEANS. And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.' 
CONSTABLE. Well plac'd! There stands your friend for the devil;

When creeping murmur and the poring dark 
Fills the wide vessel of the universe. 
From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night, 
The hum of either army stilly sounds, 
That the fix'd sentinels almost receive 
The secret whispers of each other's watch. 
Each battle sees the other's umber'd face; 
Piercing the night's dull ear; and from the tents 
The armourers accomplishing the knights, 
The country cocks do crow, the clocks do ton, 
And the third hour of drowsy morning name. 
The confident and over-lusty French 
Do the low-rated English play at dice; 
And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night 
So tediously away. The poor condemned English, 
The morning's danger; and their gesture sad 
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon 
The royal captain of this ruin'd band 
Unto the weary and all-watched night; 
A largess universal, like the sun, 
A little touch of Harry in the night.

PISTOL. The King's a bawcock and a heart of gold, 
I love the lovely bully. What is thy name? 
PISTOL. The figo for thee, then! 
FLUELLEN. So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak fewer. It is the 
greatest admiration in the universal world, when the true and 
aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept: if you 
would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great, 
pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you, you shall find the 
ceremonies of the wars, and the cares of it, and the forms of it, 
and the sobriety of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.

BATES. He hath not told his thought to the King? 
to you, I think the King is but a man as I am: the violet smells 
to him as it doth to me; the element shows to him as it doth to 
they stoop with the like wing. Therefore, when he sees reason of 
fears, as we do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish 
cold a night as 'tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the 
KING HENRY. By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I 
methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King's 
we know we are the King's subjects. If his cause be wrong, our 
obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us. 
WILLIAMS. But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a

upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I 
matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were 
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of 
many irreconcil'd iniquities, you may call the business of the 
master the author of the servant's damnation. But this is not so: 
the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his 
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; 
spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out 
with all unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them the 
virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars 
their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace 
with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law 
vengeance; so that here men are punish'd for before-breach of the 
King's laws in now the King's quarrel. Where they feared the 
they perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King

duty is the King's; but every subject's soul is his own. 
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man 
death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly

And follows so the ever-running year

What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace 
Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

O, not to-day, think not upon the fault 
My father made in compassing the crown! 
Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests 
The day, my friends, and all things, stay for me. Exeunt 
The French camp 
Enter the DAUPHIN, ORLEANS, RAMBURES, and others 
ORLEANS. The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords! 
MESSENGER. The English are embattl'd, you French peers. 
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men. 
The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them. 
And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound 
The tucket sonance and the note to mount; 
For our approach shall so much dare the field 
Ill-favouredly become the morning field; 
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks 
Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips, 
The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes, 
And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit 
And their executors, the knavish crows, 
To demonstrate the life of such a battle 
CONSTABLE. I stay but for my guidon. To the field! 
I will the banner from a trumpet take, 
The sun is high, and we outwear the day. Exeunt 
The English camp 
GLOUCESTER. Where is the King? 
BEDFORD. The King himself is rode to view their battle. 
For thou art fram'd of the firm truth of valour. 
Enter the KING 
The fewer men, the greater share of honour. 
I am the most offending soul alive. 
For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more! 
This day is call'd the feast of Crispian. 
And rouse him at the name of Crispian. 
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours, 
Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, 
This story shall the good man teach his son; 
From this day to the ending of the world, 
The French are bravely in their battles set, 
WESTMORELAND. Perish the man whose mind is backward now! 
For certainly thou art so near the gulf 
The constable desires thee thou wilt mind 
MONTJOY. The Constable of France. 
The man that once did sell the lion's skin 
While the beast liv'd was kill'd with hunting him. 
Find native graves; upon the which, I trust, 
They shall be fam'd; for there the sun shall greet them 
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France. 
That, being dead, like to the bullet's grazing 
Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable 
We are but warriors for the working-day; 
With rainy marching in the painful field; 
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim; 
The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads 
Shall yield them little, tell the Constable. 
Enter the DUKE OF YORK 
The leading of the vaward. 
And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day! Exeunt 
The field of battle

Another part of the field 
Alarum. Enter the KING and his train, with prisoners; EXETER, and others 
But all's not done- yet keep the French the field. 
EXETER. The Duke of York commends him to your Majesty. 
From helmet to the spur all blood he was. 
Larding the plain; and by his bloody side, 
The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies. 
And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes 
He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand, 
The pretty and sweet manner of it forc'd 
The French have reinforc'd their scatter'd men.

Another part of the field 
FLUELLEN. Kill the poys and the luggage! 'Tis expressly against the 
GOWER. 'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the cowardly 
rascals that ran from the battle ha' done this slaughter; 
besides, they have burned and carried away all that was in the 
King's tent; wherefore the King most worthily hath caus'd every

GOWER. Alexander the Great. 
FLUELLEN. Why, I pray you, is not 'pig' great? The pig, or great, 
or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous, are all one

Dead March. Enter the funeral of KING HENRY THE FIFTH, 
attended on by the DUKE OF BEDFORD, Regent of France, 
the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, Protector, the DUKE OF EXETER, 
the EARL OF WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER 
BEDFORD. Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to 
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky 
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars 
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long! 
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap 
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French 
WINCHESTER. He was a king bless'd of the King of kings; 
Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day 
The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought; 
The Church's prayers made him so prosperous. 
GLOUCESTER. The Church! Where is it? Had not churchmen 
And lookest to command the Prince and realm. 
GLOUCESTER. Name not religion, for thou lov'st the flesh; 
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st, 
Let's to the altar. Heralds, wait on us. 
And none but women left to wail the dead. 
HENRY the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate: 
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens. 
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns 
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost. 
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered 
Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms; 
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes, 
France is revolted from the English quite, 
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims; 
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd; 
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side. 
EXETER. The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him! 
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French. 
The circumstance I'll tell you more at large. 
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord, 
Retiring from the siege of Orleans, 
By three and twenty thousand of the French 
They pitched in the ground confusedly 
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in. 
More than three hours the fight continued; 
The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms; 
All the whole army stood agaz'd on him. 
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle. 
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up 
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward. 
He, being in the vaward plac'd behind 
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre. 
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace, 
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back; 
Durst not presume to look once in the face. 
Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise. 
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne; 
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend; 
The English army is grown weak and faint; 
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply 
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly, 
GLOUCESTER. I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can 
To view th' artillery and munition; 
EXETER. To Eltham will I, where the young King is, 
The King from Eltham I intend to steal, 
Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES THE DAUPHIN, ALENCON, 
CHARLES. Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens 
So in the earth, to this day is not known. 
Late did he shine upon the English side; 
Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts, 
REIGNIER. Let's raise the siege. Why live we idly here? 
Now for the honour of the forlorn French! 
Here alarum. They are beaten hack by the English, with 
CHARLES. Who ever saw the like? What men have I! 
The other lords, like lions wanting food, 
During the time Edward the Third did reign. 
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege. 
Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS 
BASTARD. Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him. 
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence? 
And drive the English forth the bounds of France. 
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath, 
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome: 
Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS with 
Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind; 
The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine's churchyard, 
And fightest with the sword of Deborah. 
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus. 
Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard. 
PUCELLE. Assign'd am I to be the English scourge. 
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise. 
Glory is like a circle in the water, 
With Henry's death the English circle ends; 
Dispersed are the glories it included. 
Helen, the mother of great Constantine, 
Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth, 
ALENCON. Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege. 
London. Before the Tower gates 
Enter the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, with his serving-men 
GLOUCESTER. I am come to survey the Tower this day; 
Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls. 
FIRST SERVING-MAN. It is the noble Duke of Gloucester. 
FIRST SERVING-MAN. Villains, answer you so the Lord 
FIRST WARDER. [Within] The Lord protect him! so we 
There's none Protector of the realm but I. 
Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize. 
[GLOUCESTER'S men rush at the Tower gates, and 
WOODVILLE the Lieutenant speaks within] 
Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter. 
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids. 
Thou art no friend to God or to the King. 
Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly. 
SERVING-MEN. Open the gates unto the Lord Protector, 
Enter to the PROTECTOR at the Tower gates WINCHESTER 
And not Protector of the King or realm. 
Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down. 
WINCHESTER. Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the 
Here GLOUCESTER'S men beat out the CARDINAL'S 
men; and enter in the hurly burly the MAYOR OF 
Thus contumeliously should break the peace! 
Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use. 
Because he is Protector of the realm, 
And would have armour here out of the Tower, 
To crown himself King and suppress the Prince. 
this day against God's peace and the King's, we charge 
GLOUCESTER. Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law; 
This Cardinal's more haughty than the devil. 
MAYOR. See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart. 
Enter, on the walls, the MASTER-GUNNER 
And how the English have the suburbs won. 
The Prince's espials have informed me 
How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd, 
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city, 
And thence discover how with most advantage 
And thou shalt find me at the Governor's. Exit 
Enter SALISBURY and TALBOT on the turrets, with 
TALBOT. The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner 
Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles; 
But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart 
Here, said they, is the terror of the French, 
The scarecrow that affrights our children so. 
Then broke I from the officers that led me, 
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground 
To hurl at the beholders of my shame; 
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart. 
Enter the BOY with a linstock 
And view the Frenchmen how they fortify. 
Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee. 
GARGRAVE. I think at the North Gate; for there stand lords. 
GLANSDALE. And I here, at the bulwark of the bridge. 
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars; 
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field. 
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world. 
Remember to avenge me on the French.' 
Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn. 
What stir is this? What tumult's in the heavens? 
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise? 
MESSENGER. My lord, my lord, the French have gather'd 
The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd, 
Is come with a great power to raise the siege. 
Here an alarum again, and TALBOT pursueth the 
[A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers] 
Hark, countrymen! Either renew the fight 
Or tear the lions out of England's coat; 
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf, 
Or horse or oxen from the leopard, 
The shame hereof will make me hide my head. 
Flourish. Enter on the walls, LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, 
PUCELLE. Advance our waving colours on the walls; 
Rescu'd is Orleans from the English. 
That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next. 
Recover'd is the town of Orleans. 
REIGNIER. Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the 
Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires 
And feast and banquet in the open streets 
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us. 
When they shall hear how we have play'd the men. 
CHARLES. 'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won; 
And all the priests and friars in my realm 
Than the rich jewel'd coffer of Darius, 
Before the kings and queens of France. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Near to the walls, by some apparent sign 
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard. 
By whose approach the regions of Artois, 
This happy night the Frenchmen are secure, 
To join with witches and the help of hell! 
If underneath the standard of the French 
That if it chance the one of us do fail 
The other yet may rise against their force. 
Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right 
[The English scale the walls and cry 'Saint George! 
SENTINEL. Arm! arm! The enemy doth make assault. 
The French leap o'er the walls in their shirts. 
REIGNIER. If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him 
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me? 
That, being captain of the watch to-night, 
As that whereof I had the government, 
About relieving of the sentinels. 
PUCELLE. Question, my lords, no further of the case, 
But weakly guarded, where the breach was made. 
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword; 
ORLEANS. Within the town 
BEDFORD. The day begins to break, and night is fled 
Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth. 
TALBOT. Bring forth the body of old Salisbury 
And here advance it in the market-place, 
The middle centre of this cursed town. 
Upon the which, that every one may read, 
Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans, 
The treacherous manner of his mournful death, 
I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace, 
BEDFORD. 'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began, 
Rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds, 
They did amongst the troops of armed men 
Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field. 
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night, 
Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull, 
We'll follow them with all the power we have. 
Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts 
So much applauded through the realm of France? 
TALBOT. Here is the Talbot; who would speak with him? 
MESSENGER. The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne, 
That she may boast she hath beheld the man 
Whose glory fills the world with loud report. 
AUVERGNE. The Castle 
Enter the COUNTESS and her PORTER 
And when you have done so, bring the keys to me. 
COUNTESS. The plot is laid; if all things fall out right, 
Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight, 
COUNTESS. And he is welcome. What! is this the man? 
COUNTESS. Is this the scourge of France? 
That with his name the mothers still their babes? 
To know the cause of your abrupt departure. 
But now the substance shall endure the like 
COUNTESS. Why, art not thou the man? 
For what you see is but the smallest part 
I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here, 
COUNTESS. This is a riddling merchant for the nonce; 
The mind of Talbot as you did mistake 
The outward composition of his body. 
London. The Temple garden 
Enter the EARLS OF SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK; 
SUFFOLK. Within the Temple Hall we were too loud; 
The garden here is more convenient. 
PLANTAGENET. Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth; 
Or else was wrangling Somerset in th' error? 
SUFFOLK. Faith, I have been a truant in the law 
And therefore frame the law unto my will. 
WARWICK. Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch; 
Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth; 
Between two blades, which bears the better temper; 
Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye 
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law, 
The truth appears so naked on my side 
And stands upon the honour of his birth, 
But dare maintain the party of the truth, 
And say withal I think he held the right. 
The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree 
Shall yield the other in the right opinion. 
VERNON. Then, for the truth and plainness of the case, 
Giving my verdict on the white rose side. 
Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,

Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;

The Tower of London 
Even like a man new haled from the rack, 
And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death, 
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. 
That droops his sapless branches to the ground. 
We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber; 
But now the arbitrator of despairs, 
Else with the like I had requited him.

The first-begotten and the lawful heir 
Of Edward king, the third of that descent; 
During whose reign the Percies of the north, 
Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne. 
The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this

To King Edward the Third; whereas he 
They laboured to plant the rightful heir, 
Long after this, when Henry the Fifth, 
And have install'd me in the diadem; 
But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl, 
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers, 
In whom the title rested, were suppress'd. 
PLANTAGENET. Of Which, my lord, your honour is the last. 
Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather; 
Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster 
Might but redeem the passage of your age! 
Exeunt GAOLERS, hearing out the body of MORTIMER 
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer, 
Chok'd with ambition of the meaner sort; 
And therefore haste I to the Parliament, 
Or make my ill th' advantage of my good. Exit

Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen.

It is not that that incens'd hath incens'd the Duke: 
No one but he should be about the King;

WARWICK. Ay, see the bishop be not overborne. 
And know the office that belongs to such. 
Is not his Grace Protector to the King?

That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.

GLOUCESTER. Compassion on the King commands me stoop, 
Or I would see his heart out ere the priest 
WARWICK. Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke 
And will not you maintain the thing you teach, 
But prove a chief offender in the same? 
WARWICK. Sweet King! The Bishop hath a kindly gird.

And humble service till the point of death. 
I girt thee with the valiant sword of York. 
ALL. Welcome, high Prince, the mighty Duke of York! 
To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France: 
The presence of a king engenders love 
KING HENRY. When Gloucester says the word, King Henry 
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers 
Which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth 
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe: 
PUCELLE. These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen, 
Talk like the vulgar sort of market-men 
And that we find the slothful watch but weak, 
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them. 
FIRST SOLDIER. Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,

But burning fatal to the Talbotites. Exit 
BASTARD. See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend; 
The burning torch in yonder turret stands. 
A prophet to the fall of all our foes! 
Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently, 
And then do execution on the watch. Alarum. Exeunt 
That hardly we escap'd the pride of France. Exit

'Twas full of darnel-do you like the taste? 
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.

God speed the parliament! Who shall be the Speaker? 
TALBOT. Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field? 
But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest. 
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls, 
PUCELLE. Away, captains! Let's get us from the walls; 
That we are here. Exeunt from the walls 
Either to get the town again or die; 
So sure I swear to get the town or die. 
The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord, 
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen, 
Came to the field, and vanquished his foes. 
Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts, 
Exeunt against the town all but BEDFORD and attendants 
We are like to have the overthrow again. 
All the Talbots in the world, to save my life. Exit 
Exit into the town 
What is the trust or strength of foolish man? 
An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest 
Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks? 
Now will we take some order in the town, 
And then depart to Paris to the King, 
The noble Duke of Bedford, late deceas'd, 
For that's the end of human misery. Exeunt 
The plains near Rouen 
Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD, ALENCON, LA PUCELLE, 
If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul'd. 
And we will make thee famous through the world. 
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy 
To leave the Talbot and to follow us. 
To bring this matter to the wished end. 
Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive 
There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread, 
And all the troops of English after him. 
French march. Enter the DUKE OF BURGUNDY and 
Now in the rearward comes the Duke and his. 
CHARLES. A parley with the Duke of Burgundy! 
BURGUNDY. Who craves a parley with the Burgundy? 
PUCELLE. The princely Charles of France, thy countryman. 
And see the cities and the towns defac'd 
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe; 
As looks the mother on her lowly babe 
See, see the pining malady of France; 
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds, 
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe? 
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms. 
And seek how we may prejudice the foe. Exeunt

Writ to your Grace from th' Duke of Burgundy. 
TALBOT. Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee! 
To tear the Garter from thy craven's leg, [Plucking it off] 
Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest: 
This dastard, at the battle of Patay, 
And that the French were almost ten to one, 
GLOUCESTER. To say the truth, this fact was infamous 
Knights of the Garter were of noble birth, 
Such as were grown to credit by the wars; 
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight, 
And now, my Lord Protector, view the letter

No more but plain and bluntly 'To the King!' 
Together with the pitiful complaints 
And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.' 
KING HENRY. Is that the worst this letter doth contain? 
GLOUCESTER. It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes. 
VERNON. Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign. 
BASSET. And me, my lord, grant me the combat too. 
BASSET. Crossing the sea from England into France, 
Upbraided me about the rose I wear, 
Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves 
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth 
About a certain question in the law 
Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him; 
I crave the benefit of law of arms. 
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower 
Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart. 
SOMERSET. The quarrel toucheth none but us alone; 
To trouble and disturb the King and us? 
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause. 
Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France! 
O, think upon the conquest of my father, 
Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown'd. 
Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest, 
From thence to England, where I hope ere long 
WARWICK. My Lord of York, I promise you, the King 
Prettily, methought, did play the orator. 
In that he wears the badge of Somerset. 
For had the passions of thy heart burst out, 
This shouldering of each other in the court, 
There comes the ruin, there begins confusion. Exit 
TALBOT. Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter; 
Summon their general unto the wall. 
Trumpet sounds a parley. Enter, aloft, the 
GENERAL OF THE FRENCH, and others 
You tempt the fury of my three attendants, 
Who in a moment even with the earth 
If you forsake the offer of their love. 
GENERAL OF THE FRENCH. Thou ominous and fearful owl of 
The period of thy tyranny approacheth. 
If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed, 
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee. 
To wall thee from the liberty of flight, 
And pale destruction meets thee in the face. 
Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament 
This is the latest glory of thy praise 
For ere the glass that now begins to run 
Finish the process of his sandy hour, 
Hark! hark! The Dauphin's drum, a warning bell, 
TALBOT. He fables not; I hear the enemy. 
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel 
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay. 
YORK. Are not the speedy scouts return'd again 
That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin? 
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led, 
And cannot help the noble chevalier. 
Never so needful on the earth of France, 
Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot, 
LUCY. O, send some succour to the distress'd lord! 
That sund'red friends greet in the hour of death. 
But curse the cause I cannot aid the man. 
LUCY. Thus, while the vulture of sedition 
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders, 
The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror, 
Henry the Fifth. Whiles they each other cross, 
Might with a sally of the very town 
Be buckled with. The over daring Talbot 
That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name. 
And whiles the honourable captain there 
You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour, 
The levied succours that should lend him aid, 
Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy, 
SOMERSET. York lies; he might have sent and had the horse. 
LUCY. The fraud of England, not the force of France, 
Hath now entrapp'd the noble minded Talbot. 
SOMERSET. Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight; 
LUCY. His fame lives in the world, his shame in you. Exeunt 
The English camp near Bordeaux 
The world will say he is not Talbot's blood 
Upon my death the French can little boast; 
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won; 
If the first hour I shrink and run away. 
JOHN. To fight I will, but not to fly the foe. 
Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I; 
The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word 
And left us to the rage of France his sword. 
The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done 
TALBOT. When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck 
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee. 
The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood 
From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood 
Here purposing the Bastard to destroy, 
Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly, 
Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry? 
The help of one stands me in little stead. 
'Tis but the short'ning of my life one day. 
JOHN. The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart; 
The coward horse that bears me fall and die! 
And like me to the peasant boys of France, 
Surely, by all the glory you have won, 
Another part of the field 
Into the clust'ring battle of the French; 
Enter soldiers, bearing the body of JOHN TALBOT 
Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky, 
BASTARD. How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging wood, 
To be the pillage of a giglot wench.' 
So, rushing in the bowels of the French, 
See where he lies inhearsed in the arms 
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms! 
During the life, let us not wrong it dead. 
LUCY. Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin's tent, 
To know who hath obtain'd the glory of the day. 
And to survey the bodies of the dead. 
LUCY. But where's the great Alcides of the field, 
The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge, 
Knight of the noble order of Saint George, 
Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fleece, 
Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth 
Of all his wars within the realm of France? 
The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath, 
It were enough to fright the realm of France.

As plays the sun upon the glassy streams, 
Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.

With letters of commission from the King. 
For know, my lords, the states of Christendom, 
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French; 
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train

With all the learned Council of the realm, 
Studied so long, sat in the Council House 
Razing the characters of your renown, 
Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast, 
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine 
Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style 
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse. 
SALISBURY. Now, by the death of Him that died for all, 
These counties were the keys of Normandy! 
And are the cities that I got with wounds 
That dims the honour of this warlike isle! 
It was the pleasure of my lord the King. 
And no great friend, I fear me, to the King. 
Consider, lords, he is the next of blood 
And heir apparent to the English crown. 
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west, 
What though the common people favour him, 
Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,' 
With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!' 
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk, 
I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently. Exit 
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal; 
Than all the princes in the land beside; 
Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal. 
Behoves it us to labour for the realm. 
Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal- 
More like a soldier than a man o' th' church, 
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal. 
Warwick my son, the comfort of my age, 
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons, 
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France 
Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:

While they do tend the profit of the land. 
WARWICK. So God help Warwick, as he loves the land

WARWICK. Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost- 
YORK. Anjou and Maine are given to the French; 
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy 
Suffolk concluded on the articles; 
The peers agreed; and Henry was well pleas'd 
While as the silly owner of the goods 
Methinks the realms of England, France, and Ireland, 
As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt 
Unto the prince's heart of Calydon. 
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French! 
And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts, 
And when I spy advantage, claim the crown, 
For that's the golden mark I seek to hit. 
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist, 
Nor wear the diadem upon his head, 
To pry into the secrets of the state; 
And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars; 
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose, 
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd, 
And in my standard bear the arms of York, 
To grapple with the house of Lancaster; 
And force perforce I'll make him yield the crown, 
The DUKE OF GLOUCESTER'S house 
Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load? 
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows, 
As frowning at the favours of the world? 
Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth, 
Enchas'd with all the honours of the world? 
Until thy head be circled with the same. 
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold. 
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground. 
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts! 
But, as I think, it was by th' Cardinal; 
And on the pieces of the broken wand 
Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset 
In the cathedral church of Westminster, 
And on my head did set the diadem. 
Art thou not second woman in the realm, 
And the Protector's wife, belov'd of him? 
Above the reach or compass of thy thought? 
Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk. 
HUME. But, by the grace of God and Hume's advice, 
With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch of Eie, 
With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer? 
DUCHESS. It is enough; I'll think upon the questions; 
We'll see these things effected to the full. 
HUME. Hume must make merry with the Duchess' gold; 
The business asketh silent secrecy. 
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch: 
I dare not say from the rich Cardinal, 
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk; 
Have hired me to undermine the Duchess, 
Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal's broker.

Is this the fashions in the court of England?

And this the royalty of Albion's king? 
Under the surly Gloucester's governance? 
I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours 
And stol'st away the ladies' hearts of France, 
His champions are the prophets and apostles; 
I would the college of the Cardinals 
And set the triple crown upon his head; 
QUEEN. Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beaufort 
The imperious churchman; Somerset, Buckingham, 
And grumbling York; and not the least of these 
But can do more in England than the King. 
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils; 
As that proud dame, the Lord Protector's wife. 
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies, 
Strangers in court do take her for the Queen. 
The very train of her worst wearing gown 
That she will light to listen to the lays, 
Although we fancy not the Cardinal, 
Yet must we join with him and with the lords, 
As for the Duke of York, this late complaint 
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.

QUEEN. Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook, 
Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high, 
And what a pitch she flew above the rest! 
CARDINAL. I thought as much; he would be above the clouds. 
KING HENRY. The treasury of everlasting joy! 
Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart; 
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth. 
CARDINAL. Let me be blessed for the peace I make

KING HENRY. The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords. 
SUFFOLK. Come to the King, and tell him what miracle. 
Enter the MAYOR OF SAINT ALBANS and his brethren, 
CARDINAL. Here comes the townsmen on procession 
To present your Highness with the man. 
GLOUCESTER. Stand by, my masters; bring him near the King; 
KING HENRY. Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance, 
That we for thee may glorify the Lord.

GLOUCESTER. Follow the knave, and take this drab away. 
SUFFOLK. True; made the lame to leap and fly away. 
Under the countenance and confederacy 
Of Lady Eleanor, the Protector's wife, 
The ringleader and head of all this rout, 
Whom we have apprehended in the fact, 
And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to the 
Or to the meanest groom. 
KING HENRY. O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones, 
QUEEN. Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest; 
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales, 
London. The DUKE OF YORK'S garden 
The Nevils are thy subjects to command. 
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons; 
The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales; 
The second, William of Hatfield; and the third, 
Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster; 
The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York; 
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester; 
William of Windsor was the seventh and last. 
Edward the Black Prince died before his father 
Who, after Edward the Third's death, reign'd as king 
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt, 
Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth, 
Seiz'd on the realm, depos'd the rightful king, 
WARWICK. Father, the Duke hath told the truth; 
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown. 
For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead, 
The issue of the next son should have reign'd. 
YORK. The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line 
I claim the crown, had issue Philippe, a daughter, 
SALISBURY. This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke, 
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown; 
But, to the rest. 
My mother, being heir unto the crown, 
To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son, son. 
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir 
To Roger Earl of March, who was the son 
So, if the issue of the elder son 
Succeed before the younger, I am King. 
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt, 
The fourth son: York claims it from the third. 
And in this private plot be we the first 
With honour of his birthright to the crown. 
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster; 
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence, 
At Buckingham, and all the crew of them, 
Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock, 
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey; 
WARWICK. My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick 
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king. 
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick 
The greatest man in England but the King. Exeunt

From thence unto the place of execution: 
The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes, 
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.

I cannot justify whom the law condemns.

Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm.

This is the day appointed for the combat; 
And ready are the appellant and defendant,

So please your Highness to behold the fight. 
Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.

The abject people gazing on thy face, 
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.

The Abbey at Bury St. Edmunds 
Sound a sennet. Enter the KING, the QUEEN, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, 
BUCKINGHAM, SALISBURY, and WARWICK, to the Parliament 
'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man, 
The strangeness of his alter'd countenance? 
We know the time since he was mild and affable, 
That all the court admir'd him for submission. 
But meet him now and be it in the morn, 
When every one will give the time of day, 
But great men tremble when the lion roars, 
And should you fall he is the next will mount; 
By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts; 
Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted; 
Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden 
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry. 
The reverent care I bear unto my lord 
Made me collect these dangers in the Duke. 
I will subscribe, and say I wrong'd the Duke. 
The Duchess, by his subornation, 
As next the King he was successive heir- 
Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess 
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep, 
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb. 
Levy great sums of money through the realm 
By means whereof the towns each day revolted. 
KING HENRY. My lords, at once: the care you have of us, 
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove: 
The Duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given 
For he's disposed as the hateful raven. 
For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf. 
Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all 
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man. 
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud, 
GLOUCESTER. All happiness unto my lord the King! 
The purest spring is not so free from mud 
And, being Protector, stay'd the soldiers' pay; 
I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay 
So help me God, as I have watch'd the night- 
That doit that e'er I wrested from the King, 
Because I would not tax the needy commons, 
Have I dispursed to the garrisons, 
Pity was all the fault that was in me; 
Above the felon or what trespass else. 
And prove the period of their tyranny, 
But mine is made the prologue to their play; 
The envious load that lies upon his heart; 
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon, 
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest, 
The ancient proverb will be well effected: 
And the offender granted scope of speech, 
QUEEN. But I can give the loser leave to chide. 
Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false! 
BUCKINGHAM. He'll wrest the sense, and hold us here all day. 
CARDINAL. Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure. 
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side, 
QUEEN. What, will your Highness leave the Parliament? 
The map of honour, truth, and loyalty! 
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come 
And as the butcher takes away the calf, 
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays, 
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house, 
And as the dam runs lowing up and down, 
Looking the way her harmless young one went, 
QUEEN. Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams: 
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile 
Or as the snake, roll'd in a flow'ring bank, 
That for the beauty thinks it excellent. 
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world 
To rid us from the fear we have of him. 
The King will labour still to save his life; 
The commons haply rise to save his life; 
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite 
As place Duke Humphrey for the King's Protector? 
QUEEN. So the poor chicken should be sure of death. 
To make the fox surveyor of the fold? 
By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock, 
Seeing the deed is meritorious, 
Say but the word, and I will be his priest. 
Say you consent and censure well the deed, 
I tender so the safety of my liege. 
SUFFOLK. Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing. 
And put the Englishmen unto the sword. 
Send succours, lords, and stop the rage betime, 
Before the wound do grow uncurable; 
Witness the fortune he hath had in France. 
Had been the Regent there instead of me, 
SOMERSET. And in the number, thee that wishest shame! 
Th' uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms 
And try your hap against the Irishmen? 
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey. 
And so break off; the day is almost spent. 
Resign to death- it is not worth th' enjoying. 
Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man 
My brain, more busy than the labouring spider, 
I fear me you but warm the starved snake, 
Until the golden circuit on my head, 
Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams, 
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw. 
Under the tide of John Mortimer. 
And in the end being rescu'd, I have seen 
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells. 
Hath he conversed with the enemy, 
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind, 
How they affect the house and claim of York. 
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd; 
And Henry put apart, the next for me. Exit 
Enter two or three MURDERERS running over the stage, 
from the murder of DUKE HUMPHREY 
We have dispatch'd the Duke, as he commanded. 
The King and all the peers are here at hand. 
Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well, 
Sound trumpets. Enter the KING, the QUEEN, 
Where is our uncle? What's the matter, Suffolk? 
The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word. 
[The KING swoons] 
QUEEN. How fares my lord? Help, lords! The King is dead. 
SOMERSET. Rear up his body; wring him by the nose. 
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren, 
Can chase away the first conceived sound? 
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world. 
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight; 
For in the shade of death I shall find joy- 
Although the Duke was enemy to him, 
And all to have the noble Duke alive. 
What know I how the world may deem of me? 
It may be judg'd I made the Duke away; 
What, art thou like the adder waxen deaf? 
Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea, 
What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts, 
The pretty-vaulting sea refus'd to drown me, 
The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands 
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back, 
I stood upon the hatches in the storm; 
And when the dusky sky began to rob 
And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv'd it; 
The agent of thy foul inconstancy- 
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means. 
The commons, like an angry hive of bees 
Until they hear the order of his death. 
With the rude multitude till I return. Exit 
Exit SALISBURY with the commons 
Bed put forth with the body. Enter WARWICK 
Upon the life of this thrice-famed Duke. 
WARWICK. See how the blood is settled in his face. 
Being all descended to the labouring heart, 
Who, in the conflict that it holds with death, 
Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy, 
Which with the heart there cools, and ne'er returneth 
To blush and beautify the cheek again. 
Look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking; 
Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged. 
The least of all these signs were probable. 
SUFFOLK. Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death? 
And you, forsooth, had the good Duke to keep. 
WARWICK. Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh, 
But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter? 
Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest 
But may imagine how the bird was dead, 
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak? 
QUEEN. Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife? 
And never of the Nevils' noble race. 
WARWICK. But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee, 
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee, 
SUFFOLK. The trait'rous Warwick, with the men of Bury, 
SALISBURY. [To the Commons within] Sirs, stand apart, the King 
Dread lord, the commons send you word by me 
They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died; 
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal. 
COMMONS. [Within] An answer from the King, my Lord of Salisbury! 
SUFFOLK. 'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds, 
But all the honour Salisbury hath won 
Is that he was the lord ambassador 
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King. 
COMMONS. [Within] An answer from the King, or we will all break in! 
But three days longer, on the pain of death. 
The world shall not be ransom for thy life. 
There's two of you; the devil make a third, 
Would curses kill as doth the mandrake's groan, 
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint, 
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste! 
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss, 
And boding screech-owls make the consort full! 
all the foul terrors in dark-seated hell- 
And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass, 
And turns the force of them upon thyself. 
Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from, 
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place 
That thou might'st think upon these by the seal, 
Once by the King and three times thrice by thee, 
'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence; 
For where thou art, there is the world itself, 
With every several pleasure in the world; 
That makes him gasp, and stare, and catch the air, 
Were by his side; sometime he calls the King 
The secrets of his overcharged soul; 
QUEEN. Go tell this heavy message to the King. Exit VAUX 
And with the southern clouds contend in tears- 
Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows? 
Now get thee hence: the King, thou know'st, is coming; 
Here could I breathe my soul into the air, 
As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe

Enter the KING, SALISBURY, and WARWICK, to the CARDINAL in bed 
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them. 
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary 
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.

And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head: 
On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France. 
The King hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble. 
To know the reason of these arms in peace; 
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court. 
I am far better born than is the King, 
The cause why I have brought this army hither 
Is to remove proud Somerset from the King, 
Seditious to his Grace and to the state. 
The King hath yielded unto thy demand: 
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower. 
Enter the KING, and attendants 
YORK. To heave the traitor Somerset from hence, 
May pass into the presence of a king, 
The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew. 
KING HENRY. The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou! 
Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him? 
Enter the QUEEN and SOMERSET 
KING HENRY. See, Buckingham! Somerset comes with th' Queen: 
Go, bid her hide him quickly from the Duke. 
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset? 
Is able with the change to kill and cure. 
And with the same to act controlling laws. 
Of capital treason 'gainst the King and crown. 
To say if that the bastard boys of York 
Shall be the surety for their traitor father. 
The sons of York, thy betters in their birth, 
That for my surety will refuse the boys! 
CLIFFORD. Health and all happiness to my lord the King! 
To Bedlam with him! Is the man grown mad? 
CLIFFORD. He is a traitor; let him to the Tower, 
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears, 
That with the very shaking of their chains 
Enter the EARLS OF WARWICK and SALISBURY 
And manacle the berard in their chains, 
If thou dar'st bring them to the baiting-place. 
Who, being suffer'd, with the bear's fell paw, 
What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian 
If it be banish'd from the frosty head, 
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth? 
That bows unto the grave with mickle age. 
The tide of this most renowned duke, 
The rightful heir to England's royal seat. 
To reave the orphan of his patrimony, 
To wring the widow from her custom'd right, 
YORK. Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast, 
CLIFFORD. The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true. 
To keep thee from the tempest of the field. 
The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff, 
As on a mountain-top the cedar shows, 
Even to affright thee with the view thereof. 
Despite the berard that protects the bear. 
To quell the rebels and their complices. 
Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK 
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear, 
Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum 
And dead men's cries do fill the empty air, 
YORK. The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed; 
Even of the bonny beast he lov'd so well. 
WARWICK. Of one or both of us the time is come. 
CLIFFORD. My soul and body on the action both! 
YOUNG CLIFFORD. Shame and confusion! All is on the rout; 
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part 
The name of valour. [Sees his father's body] 
O, let the vile world end 
And the premised flames of the last day 
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast, 
The silver livery of advised age, 
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire; 
And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims, 
Meet I an infant of the house of York, 
Exit with the body 
The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset 
Hath made the wizard famous in his death. 
KING HENRY. Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay. 
To give the enemy way, and to secure us 
If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom 
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts. 
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth, 
By th' mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard: 
For, as I hear, the King is fled to London 
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.

London. The Parliament House 
WARWICK. I wonder how the King escap'd our hands. 
YORK. While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north, 
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland, 
Cheer'd up the drooping army, and himself, 
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain. 
MONTAGUE. And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood, 
Whom I encount'red as the battles join'd. 
NORFOLK. Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt! 
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps, 
This is the palace of the fearful King, 
And this the regal seat. Possess it, York; 
WARWICK. And when the King comes, offer him no violence. 
YORK. The Queen this day here holds her parliament, 
WARWICK. The bloody parliament shall this be call'd, 
WARWICK. Neither the King, nor he that loves him best, 
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster, 
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown. 
[YORK occupies the throne] 
KING HENRY. My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits, 
Even in the chair of state! Belike he means, 
Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer, 
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king. 
CLIFFORD. The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel. 
My gracious lord, here in the parliament 
Let us assail the family of York. 
KING HENRY. Ah, know you not the city favours them, 
EXETER. But when the Duke is slain they'll quickly fly. 
KING HENRY. Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart, 
To make a shambles of the parliament house! 
Shall be the war that Henry means to use. 
YORK. 'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was. 
EXETER. Thy father was a traitor to the crown. 
WARWICK. Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown 
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain. 
That we are those which chas'd you from the field, 
March'd through the city to the palace gates. 
YORK. Will you we show our title to the crown? 
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field. 
KING HENRY. What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown? 
I am the son of Henry the Fifth, 
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop, 
KING HENRY. The Lord Protector lost it, and not I: 
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head. 
RICHARD. Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly. 
KING HENRY. Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown. 
For Richard, in the view of many lords, 
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth, 
But that the next heir should succeed and reign. 
EXETER. His is the right, and therefore pardon me. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st, 
Can set the Duke up in despite of me. 
Or I will fill the house with armed men, 
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,

KING HENRY. And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court. 
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and the PRINCE OF WALES 
EXETER. Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger. 
The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc'd me. 
And giv'n unto the house of York such head 
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown, 
Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais; 
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas; 
The Duke is made Protector of the realm; 
The trembling lamb environed with wolves. 
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes 
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours 
And utter ruin of the house of York. 
PRINCE OF WALES. When I return with victory from the field 
Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and the PRINCE 
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son! 
The loss of those three lords torments my heart. 
Come, cousin, you shall be the messenger. 
EDWARD. No, I can better play the orator. 
Enter the DUKE OF YORK 
The crown of England, father, which is yours. 
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe, 
It will outrun you, father, in the end. 
RICHARD. I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak. 
Henry had none, but did usurp the place; 
Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd 
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart. 
Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk 
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise; 
And yet the King not privy to my drift, 
Nor any of the house of Lancaster? 
MESSENGER. The Queen with all the northern earls and lords 
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest, 
Whom we have left protectors of the King, 
The army of the Queen mean to besiege us. 
SIR JOHN. She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field. 
YORK. Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great, 
When as the enemy hath been ten to one; 
Why should I not now have the like success? Exeunt 
As for the brat of this accursed duke, 
RUTLAND. So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch 
Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter. 
The sight of any of the house of York 
Another part of the field 
Alarum. Enter the DUKE OF YORK 
YORK. The army of the Queen hath got the field. 
And all my followers to the eager foe 
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind, 
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt 
And when the hardiest warriors did retire, 
With bootless labour swim against the tide 
Ah, hark! The fatal followers do pursue, 
The sands are numb'red that make up my life; 
the PRINCE OF WALES, and soldiers 
And made an evening at the noontide prick. 
YORK. My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth 
So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons; 
Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers. 
I would prolong awhile the traitor's life. 
CLIFFORD. Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. So doth the cony struggle in the net. 
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand. 
The wanton Edward and the lusty George? 
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland? 
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood 
Made issue from the bosom of the boy; 
And rob his temples of the diadem, 
Off with the crown and with the crown his head; 
QUEEN MARGARET. Nay, stay; let's hear the orisons he makes. 
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth! 
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples, 
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem, 
Unless the adage must be verified, 
The contrary doth make thee wond'red at. 
The want thereof makes thee abominable. 
As the Antipodes are unto us, 
Or as the south to the septentrion. 
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child, 
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal, 
And when the rage allays, the rain begins. 
YORK. That face of his the hungry cannibals 
And I with tears do wash the blood away. 
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this; 
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right, 
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears; 
There, take the crown, and with the crown my curse; 
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world; 
Think but upon the wrong he did us all, 
So York may overlook the town of York.

Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news; 
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news; 
The happy tidings of his good escape. 
I saw him in the battle range about, 
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop 
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him. 
See how the morning opes her golden gates 
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun. 
How well resembles it the prime of youth, 
Not separated with the racking clouds, 
In this the heaven figures some event. 
EDWARD. 'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of. 
I think it cites us, brother, to the field, 
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet, 
And overshine the earth, as this the world. 
You love the breeder better than the male. 
When as the noble Duke of York was slain, 
And stood against them as the hope of Troy 
Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy. 
Hews down and fells the hardest-timber'd oak. 
But only slaught'red by the ireful arm 
Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen, 
Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite, 
The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks 
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood 
They took his head, and on the gates of York 
They set the same; and there it doth remain, 
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd. 
The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry; 
Might in the ground be closed up in rest! 
To weep is to make less the depth of grief. 
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun; 
The words would add more anguish than the wounds. 
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain! 
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death. 
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought, 
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run, 
I, then in London, keeper of the King, 
March'd toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen, 
Bearing the King in my behalf along; 
But whether 'twas the coldness of the King, 
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight 
And we in them no hope to win the day; 
So that we fled: the King unto the Queen; 
For in the marches here we heard you were 
EDWARD. Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick? 
WARWICK. Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers; 
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head 
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist, 
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes 
If for the last, say 'Ay,' and to it, lords. 
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting Queen, 
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland, 
Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax. 
His oath enrolled in the parliament; 
And now to London all the crew are gone 
May make against the house of Lancaster. 
Now if the help of Norfolk and myself, 
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March, 
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure, 
And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!- 
The next degree is England's royal throne, 
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head. 
But sound the trumpets and about our task. 
MESSENGER. The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me 
The Queen is coming with a puissant host, 
Flourish. Enter KING HENRY, QUEEN MARGARET, the PRINCE OF WALES, CLIFFORD, 
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy 
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord? 
KING HENRY. Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck- 
Not to the beast that would usurp their den. 
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick? 
Who scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting? 
The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on, 
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy; 
KING HENRY. Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator, 
For all the rest is held at such a rate 
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown, 
And in that quarrel use it to the death. 
Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York, 
And in the towns, as they do march along, 
CLIFFORD. I would your Highness would depart the field: 
The Queen hath best success when you are absent. 
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field? 
You that are King, though he do wear the crown, 
Who should succeed the father but the son? 
Or any he, the proudest of thy sort. 
RICHARD. For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight. 
WARWICK. What say'st thou, Henry? Wilt thou yield the crown? 
WARWICK. 'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence. 
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain 
The execution of my big-swol'n heart 
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed. 
CLIFFORD. My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here 
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown. 
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided, 
Whose father bears the title of a king- 
As if a channel should be call'd the sea- 
His father revell'd in the heart of France, 
And tam'd the King, and made the Dauphin stoop; 
And we, in pity of the gentle King, 
We set the axe to thy usurping root; 
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves, 
Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak. 
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk, 
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance; 
And in the very pangs of death he cried, 
So, underneath the belly of their steeds, 
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost. 
WARWICK. Then let the earth be drunken with our blood. 
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage, 
And look upon, as if the tragedy 
And ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face 
As victors wear at the Olympian games. 
Another part of the field 
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York, 
This is the hand that stabbed thy father York; 
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland; 
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death 
To execute the like upon thyself; 
Another part of the field 
KING HENRY. This battle fares like to the morning's war, 
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, 
Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind; 
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea 
Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind. 
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind; 
Now one the better, then another best; 
So is the equal poise of this fell war. 
To whom God will, there be the victory! 
Have chid me from the battle, swearing both 
They prosper best of all when I am thence. 
Thereby to see the minutes how they run- 
How many makes the hour full complete, 
How many hours brings about the day, 
How many days will finish up the year, 
When this is known, then to divide the times- 
So many weeks ere the poor fools will can; 
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece: 
Pass'd over to the end they were created, 
Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade 
And to conclude: the shepherd's homely curds, 
SON. Ill blows the wind that profits nobody. 
From London by the King was I press'd forth; 
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man, 
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master; 
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart 
The red rose and the white are on his face, 
The fatal colours of our striving houses: 
The one his purple blood right well resembles; 
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth. 
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish! 
KING HENRY. How will the country for these woeful chances 
Misthink the King, and not be satisfied! 
Exit with the body 
Even for the loss of thee, having no more, 
Exit with the body 
Having the fearful flying hare in sight, 
Whither the Queen intends. Forward; away! Exeunt 
Another part of the field 
The common people swarm like summer flies; 
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun? 
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth! 
Giving no ground unto the house of York, 
The foe is merciless and will not pity; 
The air hath got into my deadly wounds, 
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest; 
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks. 
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded Queen 
Command an argosy to stern the waves. 
For, though before his face I speak the words, 
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave; 
EDWARD. And now the battle's ended, 
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch 
But set his murd'ring knife unto the root 
WARWICK. From off the gates of York fetch down the head, 
Instead whereof let this supply the room. 
Which in the time of death he gave our father. 
RICHARD. What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard 
This hand should chop it off, and with the issuing blood 
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst 
WARWICK. Ay, but he's dead. Off with the traitor's head, 
And rear it in the place your father's stands. 
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France, 
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen. 
The scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again; 
First will I see the coronation; 
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea 
And never will I undertake the thing

For through this laund anon the deer will come; 
Culling the principal of all the deer. 
SECOND KEEPER. I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot. 
FIRST KEEPER. That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow 
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost. 
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best; 
And, for the time shall not seem tedious, 
This is the quondam King; let's seize upon him. 
For wise men say it is the wisest course. 
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick 
Is thither gone to crave the French King's sister 
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn; 
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong, 
And in conclusion wins the King from her 
You are the king King Edward hath depos'd; 
And as the air blows it to me again, 
Commanded always by the greater gust, 
Such is the lightness of you common men. 
Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;

And go we, brothers, to the man that took him 
To cross me from the golden time I look for! 
The lustful Edward's title buried- 
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies, 
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence, 
So do I wish the crown, being so far off; 
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it; 
And so I say I'll cut the causes off, 
What other pleasure can the world afford? 
That carries no impression like the dam. 
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown, 
And yet I know not how to get the crown, 
That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns, 
Seeking a way and straying from the way 
Not knowing how to find the open air, 
Torment myself to catch the English crown; 
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall; 
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk; 
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor, 
I can add colours to the chameleon, 
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.

To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart; 
For though usurpers sway the rule a while 
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain; 
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth, 
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest; 
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth, 
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost 
All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten? 
But for the rest: you tell a pedigree 
WARWICK. Can Oxford that did ever fence the right 
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere, 
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years, 
When nature brought him to the door of death? 
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster. 
WARWICK. And I the house of York. 
LEWIS. But is he gracious in the people's eye? 
WARWICK. The more that Henry was unfortunate. 
Tell me for truth the measure of his love 
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground, 
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun, 
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain. 
Touching the jointure that your king must make, 
That Bona shall be wife to the English king. 
PRINCE OF WALES. To Edward, but not to the English king. 
But if your title to the crown be weak, 
Enter the POST 
I hope all's for the best. 
LEWIS. What, has your king married the Lady Grey? 
Is this th' alliance that he seeks with France? 
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss, 
Did I forget that by the house of York 
Did I let pass th' abuse done to my niece? 
Did I impale him with the regal crown? 
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame? 
And force the tyrant from his seat by war. 
I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake. 
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle: 
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me, 
I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown, 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
London. The palace 
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey? 
SOMERSET. My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King. 
and others. Four stand on one side, and four on the other 
CLARENCE. As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick, 
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey 
About the marriage of the Lady Bona. 
MONTAGUE. But the safer when 'tis back'd with France. 
Let us be back'd with God, and with the seas 
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford. 
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales 
Unto the brother of your loving bride. 
CLARENCE. Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir 
Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son, 
To play the broker in mine own behalf; 
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath. 
GLOUCESTER. [Aside] I hear, yet say not much, but think the more. 
'Go tell false Edward, the supposed king, 
I'll wear the willow-garland for his sake.' 
She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen? 
KING EDWARD. Belike she minds to play the Amazon. 
Than all the rest, discharg'd me with these words: 
KING EDWARD. Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words? 
CLARENCE. Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger. 
Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown. 
Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen; 
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest, 
The common people by numbers swarm to us. 
His soldiers lurking in the towns about, 
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy; 
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds, 
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle, 
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader. 
Enter three WATCHMEN, to guard the KING'S tent 
The King by this is set him down to sleep. 
SECOND WATCHMAN. To-morrow then, belike, shall be the day, 
That with the King here resteth in his tent? 
FIRST WATCHMAN. 'Tis the Lord Hastings, the King's chiefest friend. 
THIRD WATCHMAN. O, is it So? But why commands the King 
While he himself keeps in the cold field? 
SECOND WATCHMAN. 'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous. 
WARWICK and the rest cry all 'Warwick! Warwick!' and 
set upon the guard, who fly, crying 'Arm! Arm!' WARWICK 
and the rest following them 
The drum playing and trumpet sounding, re-enter WARWICK 
and the rest, bringing the KING out in his gown, 
sitting in a chair. GLOUCESTER and HASTINGS fly over the stage 
WARWICK. Richard and Hastings. Let them go; here is the Duke. 
KING EDWARD. The Duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted, 
WARWICK. Ay, but the case is alter'd. 
Nor how to study for the people's welfare, 
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel. 
But Henry now shall wear the English crown 
And be true King indeed; thou but the shadow. 
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him. 
WARWICK. Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do; 
And see him seated in the regal throne. Exeunt 
London. The palace 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, but the loss of his own royal person. 
Is new committed to the Bishop of York, 
Warwick may lose that now hath won the day. 
And I the rather wean me from despair 
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs, 
King Edward's fruit, true heir to th' English crown. 
To set the crown once more on Henry's head. 
Guess thou the rest: King Edward's friends must down. 
But to prevent the tyrant's violence- 
I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary 
To save at least the heir of Edward's right. 
Into this chiefest thicket of the park. 
Thus stands the case: you know our King, my brother, 
Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands 
Under the colour of his usual game, 
HUNTSMAN. This way, my lord; for this way lies the game. 
KING EDWARD. Nay, this way, man. See where the huntsmen stand. 
Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, 
Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop's deer? 
GLOUCESTER. Brother, the time and case requireth haste; 
Your horse stands ready at the park corner. 
HASTINGS. To Lynn, my lord; and shipt from thence to Flanders. 
And pray that I may repossess the crown. Exeunt 
London. The Tower 
EARL OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER, and attendants 
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat 
He was the author, thou the instrument. 
And that the people of this blessed land 
Warwick, although my head still wear the crown, 
For few men rightly temper with the stars; 
CLARENCE. No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway, 
To whom the heav'ns in thy nativity 
While he enjoys the honour and his ease. 
KING HENRY. But, with the first of all your chief affairs, 
And the Lord Hastings, who attended him 
In secret ambush on the forest side 
And from the Bishop's huntsmen rescu'd him; 
Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst, 
OXFORD. Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown, 
'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down. 
KING EDWARD. Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest, 
Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas, 
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York, 
GLOUCESTER. The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this; 
For many men that stumble at the threshold 
Enter, on the walls, the MAYOR OF YORK and 
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves, 
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York. 
GLOUCESTER. [Aside] But when the fox hath once got in his nose, 
He'll soon find means to make the body follow. 
Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends. 
MAYOR. Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be open'd. 
HASTINGS. The good old man would fain that all were well, 
Enter, below, the MAYOR and two ALDERMEN 
But in the night or in the time of war. 
What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys; 
For Edward will defend the town and thee, 
Our title to the crown, and only claim 
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest. 
[The drum begins to march] 
By what safe means the crown may be recover'd. 
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends. 
And Henry but usurps the diadem. 
SOLDIER. [Reads] 'Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, 
ALL. Long live Edward the Fourth! 
And when the morning sun shall raise his car 
Above the border of this horizon, 
Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it beseems the 
Come on, brave soldiers; doubt not of the day, 
London. The palace 
Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas 
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee. 
My sovereign, with the loving citizens, 
Like to his island girt in with the ocean 
OXFORD. [Kissing the KING'S band] And thus I seal my truth and bid 
Exeunt all but the KING and EXETER 
KING HENRY. Here at the palace will I rest a while. 
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field 
EXETER. The doubt is that he will seduce the rest. 
And, when the lion fawns upon the lamb, 
The lamb will never cease to follow him. 
KING EDWARD. Seize on the shame-fac'd Henry, bear him hence; 
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow. 
And swell so much the higher by their ebb. 
Hence with him to the Tower: let him not speak. 
The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay, 
And take the great-grown traitor unawares. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Enter WARWICK, the MAYOR OF COVENTRY, two MESSENGERS, 
and others upon the walls 
WARWICK. Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford? 
Where is the post that came from Montague? 
The drum your Honour hears marcheth from Warwick. 
KING EDWARD. Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle. 
GLOUCESTER. See how the surly Warwick mans the wall. 
KING EDWARD. Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates, 
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York. 
GLOUCESTER. I thought, at least, he would have said the King; 
Or did he make the jest against his will? 
WARWICK. 'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother. 
What is the body when the head is off? 
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten, 
The king was slily finger'd from the deck! 
You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace, 
And ten to one you'll meet him in the Tower. 
GLOUCESTER. Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down. 
Nay, when? Strike now, or else the iron cools. 
And with the other fling it at thy face, 
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood: 
[He and his forces enter the city] 
GLOUCESTER. The gates are open, let us enter too. 
If not, the city being but of small defence, 
We'll quietly rouse the traitors in the same. 
[He and his forces enter the city] 
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear. 
KING EDWARD. The harder match'd, the greater victory. 
[He and his forces enter the city] 
Have sold their lives unto the house of York; 
And thou shalt be the third, if this sword hold. 
More than the nature of a brother's love. 
CLARENCE. [Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing 
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together, 
To bend the fatal instruments of war 
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears? 
KING EDWARD. Yes, Warwick, Edward dares and leads the way. 
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory! 
That I must yield my body to the earth 
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe. 
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge, 
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle, 
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept, 
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun 
To search the secret treasons of the world; 
The wrinkles in my brows, now fill'd with blood, 
The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power; 
Even now we heard the news. Ah, couldst thou fly! 
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick, 
OXFORD. Away, away, to meet the Queen's great power! 
Another part of the field 
Flourish. Enter KING in triumph; with GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest 
But in the midst of this bright-shining day 
I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen 
And blow it to the source from whence it came; 
GLOUCESTER. The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong, 
We, having now the best at Barnet field, 
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away. Exeunt 
What though the mast be now blown overboard, 
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost, 
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood; 
Should leave the helm and, like a fearful lad, 
With tearful eyes add water to the sea 
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock, 
Our slaught'red friends the tackles; what of these? 
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings? 
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge? 
We will not from the helm to sit and weep, 
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no, 
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair. 
All these the enemies to our poor bark. 
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink. 
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off, 
That there's no hop'd-for mercy with the brothers 
And make him of the like spirit to himself. 
Go home to bed and, like the owl by day, 
KING EDWARD. Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood 
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength, 
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night. 
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords. 
Ye see, I drink the water of my eye. 
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd, 
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil. 
Be valiant, and give signal to the fight. 
Another part of the field 
KING EDWARD. Bring forth the gallant; let us hear him speak. 
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to? 
Whilst I propose the self-same words to the 
GLOUCESTER. That you might still have worn the petticoat 
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster. 
KING EDWARD. Take that, the likeness of this railer here. 
GLOUCESTER. Why should she live to fill the world with words? 
GLOUCESTER. Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother. 
GLOUCESTER. The Tower! the Tower! Exit 
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse. 
To make a bloody supper in the Tower. 
Now march we hence. Discharge the common sort 
London. The Tower 
Enter KING HENRY and GLOUCESTER with the LIEUTENANT, on the walls 
KING HENRY. So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf; 
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece, 
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife. 
GLOUCESTER. Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind: 
The thief doth fear each bush an officer. 
KING HENRY. The bird that hath been limed in a bush 
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird, 
Have now the fatal object in my eye 
That taught his son the office of a fowl! 
And yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd. 
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy, 
Thy brother Edward; and thyself, the sea 
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born. 
The owl shriek'd at thy birth- an evil sign; 
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time; 
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top, 
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree. 
To signify thou cam'st to bite the world; 
And if the rest be true which I have heard, 
For this, amongst the rest, was I ordain'd. 
GLOUCESTER. What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster 
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted. 
See how my sword weeps for the poor King's death. 
From those that wish the downfall of our house! 
I came into the world with my legs forward. 
The midwife wonder'd; and the women cried 
That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog. 
Then, since the heavens have shap'd my body so, 
Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light, 
King Henry and the Prince his son are gone. 
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest; 
Exit with the body 
London. The palace 
HASTINGS, NURSE, with the Young PRINCE, and attendants 
Repurchas'd with the blood of enemies. 
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son; 
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound; 
With them the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague, 
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion 
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd. 
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night, 
That thou might'st repossess the crown in peace; 
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain. 
For yet I am not look'd on in the world. 
Work thou the way- and that shall execute. 
CLARENCE. The duty that I owe unto your Majesty 
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe. 
GLOUCESTER. And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st, 
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit. 
[Aside] To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master 
Reignier, her father, to the King of France 
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem, 
And now what rests but that we spend the time 
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?

London. The palace 
Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one door; at the other, 
the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and the LORD ABERGAVENNY 
Met in the vale of Andren. 
BUCKINGHAM. All the whole time 
The view of earthly glory; men might say, 
Became the next day's master, till the last 
Made former wonders its. To-day the French, 
Shone down the English; and to-morrow they 
As cherubins, an gilt; the madams too, 
The pride upon them, that their very labour 
Was cried incomparable; and th' ensuing night 
Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings, 
The noble spirits to arms, they did perform 
In honour honesty, the tract of ev'rything 
To the disposing of it nought rebell'd; 
Order gave each thing view. The office did 
I mean, who set the body and the limbs 
NORFOLK. All this was ord'red by the good discretion 
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York. 
BUCKINGHAM. The devil speed him! No man's pie is freed 
Take up the rays o' th' beneficial sun, 
And keep it from the earth. 
For high feats done to th' crown, neither allied 
The force of his own merit makes his way- 
A place next to the King. 
If not from hell, the devil is a niggard 
BUCKINGHAM. Why the devil, 
Without the privity o' th' King-t' appoint 
Who should attend on him? He makes up the file 
Of all the gentry; for the most part such 
The honourable board of council out, 
Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have 
The peace between the French and us not values 
The cost that did conclude it. 
After the hideous storm that follow'd, was 
Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded 
The sudden breach on't. 
For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd 
Th' ambassador is silenc'd? 
The state takes notice of the private difference 
Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you- 
The Cardinal's malice and his potency 
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before 
him, certain of the guard, and two SECRETARIES 
with papers. The CARDINAL in his passage fixeth his 
WOLSEY. The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor? Ha! 
Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best 
Ask God for temp'rance; that's th' appliance only 
He bores me with some trick. He's gone to th' King; 
BUCKINGHAM. I'll to the King, 
The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er 
If with the sap of reason you would quench 
Or but allay the fire of passion. 
Whom from the flow of gan I name not, but 
BUCKINGHAM. To th' King I'll say't, and make my vouch as strong 
As here at home, suggests the King our master 
To this last costly treaty, th' interview 
Did break i' th' wrenching. 
The articles o' th' combination drew 
As give a crutch to th' dead. But our Count-Cardinal 
To th' old dam treason: Charles the Emperor, 
Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt- 
His fears were that the interview betwixt 
Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor 
Ere it was ask'd-but when the way was made, 
And pav'd with gold, the Emperor thus desir'd, 
That he would please to alter the King's course, 
And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know, 
As soon he shall by me, that thus the Cardinal 
and two or three of the guard 
My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl 
Arrest thee of high treason, in the name 
The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish 
The business present; 'tis his Highness' pleasure 
You shall to th' Tower. 
Which makes my whit'st part black. The will of heav'n 
[To ABERGAVENNY] The King 
Is pleas'd you shall to th' Tower, till you know 
ABERGAVENNY. As the Duke said, 
The will of heaven be done, and the King's pleasure 
The King t' attach Lord Montacute and the bodies 
Of the Duke's confessor, John de la Car, 
These are the limbs o' th' plot; no more, I hope. 
BRANDON. A monk o' th' Chartreux. 
BUCKINGHAM. My surveyor is false. The o'er-great Cardinal 
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham, 
London. The Council Chamber 
Cornets. Enter KING HENRY, leaning on the CARDINAL'S shoulder, the NOBLES, 
and SIR THOMAS LOVELL, with others. The CARDINAL places himself 
under the KING'S feet on his right side 
KING. My life itself, and the best heart of it, 
Thanks you for this great care; I stood i' th' level 
And point by point the treasons of his master 
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' 
Enter the QUEEN, usher'd by the DUKES OF NORFOLK 
and SUFFOLK; she kneels. The KING riseth 
The other moiety ere you ask is given; 
The dignity of your office, is the point 
Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart 
Of these exactions, yet the King our master- 
The sides of loyalty, and almost appears 
The clothiers all, not able to maintain 
The many to them 'longing, have put of 
The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who 
Daring th' event to th' teeth, are all in uproar, 
Pertains to th' state, and front but in that file 
Most pestilent to th' hearing; and to bear 'em 
The back is sacrifice to th' load. They say 
The nature of it? In what kind, let's know, 
Under your promis'd pardon. The subjects' grief 
The sixth part of his substance, to be levied 
Without delay; and the pretence for this 
By learned approbation of the judges. If I am 
The chronicles of my doing, let me say 
'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake 
Our necessary actions in the fear 
From every tree lop, bark, and part o' th' timber; 
The air will drink the sap. To every county 
The force of this commission. Pray, look tot; 
WOLSEY. [Aside to the SECRETARY] A word with you. 
Of the King's grace and pardon. The grieved commons 
Further in the proceeding. Exit SECRETARY 
QUEEN KATHARINE. I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham 
The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker; 
Not well dispos'd, the mind growing once corrupt, 
Hath into monstrous habits put the graces 
The fore-recited practices, whereof 
Out of the Duke of Buckingham. 
It would infect his speech-that if the King 
To make the sceptre his. These very words 
Revenge upon the Cardinal. 
How grounded he his title to the crown 
The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish 
What was the speech among the Londoners 
Concerning the French journey. I replied 
Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious, 
To the King's danger. Presently the Duke 
Said 'twas the fear indeed and that he doubted 
'Twould prove the verity of certain words 
Whom after under the confession's seal 
This pausingly ensu'd: "Neither the King nor's heirs, 
Tell you the Duke, shall prosper; bid him strive 
To gain the love o' th' commonalty; the Duke 
You were the Duke's surveyor, and lost your office 
On the complaint o' th' tenants. Take good heed 
I told my lord the Duke, by th' devil's illusions 
The monk might be deceiv'd, and that 'twas dangerous 
That, had the King in his last sickness fail'd, 
The Cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads 
After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke 
The Duke retain'd him his. But on: what hence? 
As to the Tower I thought-I would have play'd 
The part my father meant to act upon 
Th' usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury, 
SURVEYOR. After 'the Duke his father' with the 'knife,' 
Find mercy in the law, 'tis his; if none, 
He's traitor to th' height. Exeunt 
London. The palace 
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN and LORD SANDYS 
CHAMBERLAIN. Is't possible the spells of France should juggle 
CHAMBERLAIN. As far as I see, all the good our English 
Have got by the late voyage is but merely 
A fit or two o' th' face; but they are shrewd ones; 
That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin 
That sure th' have worn out Christendom. 
I hear of none but the new proclamation 
That's clapp'd upon the court gate. 
LOVELL. The reformation of our travell'd gallants, 
That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors. 
And never see the Louvre. 
For so run the conditions, leave those remnants 
The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings, 
The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at. 
There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons 
SANDYS. The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going, 
LOVELL. To the Cardinal's; 
The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you. 
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us; 
London. The Presence Chamber in York Place 
Hautboys. A small table under a state for the Cardinal, 
a longer table for the guests. Then enter ANNE BULLEN, 
The very thought of this fair company 
SANDYS. Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal 
Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this. 
The penance lies on you if these fair ladies 
SANDYS. The red wine first must rise 
By all the laws of war y'are privileg'd. 
For so they seem. Th' have left their barge and landed, 
Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue; 
Hautboys. Enter the KING, and others, as maskers, 
habited like shepherds, usher'd by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN. 
They pass directly before the CARDINAL, 
Out of the great respect they bear to beauty, 
[They choose ladies. The KING chooses ANNE BULLEN] 
KING. The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty, 
[He whispers to the maskers] 
The Viscount Rochford-one of her Highness' women. 
WOLSEY. Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready 
I' th' privy chamber? 
In the next chamber. 
Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Ev'n to the Hall, to hear what shall become 
Of the great Duke of Buckingham. 
That labour, sir. All's now done but the ceremony 
Of bringing back the prisoner. 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. I'll tell you in a little. The great Duke. 
Came to the bar; where to his accusations 
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law. 
The King's attorney, on the contrary, 
Urg'd on the examinations, proofs, confessions, 
Of divers witnesses; which the Duke desir'd 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. The same. 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. When he was brought again to th' bar to hear 
In all the rest show'd a most noble patience. 
He never was so womanish; the cause 
The Cardinal is the end of this. 
And generally: whoever the King favours 
The Cardinal instantly will find employment, 
SECOND GENTLEMAN. All the commons 
The mirror of all courtesy- 
before him; the axe with the edge towards him; halberds 
And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of. 
Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful! 
The law I bear no malice for my death: 
'T has done, upon the premises, but justice. 
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men, 
Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies 
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me 
Yet are the King's, and, till my soul forsake, 
LOVELL. To th' water side I must conduct your Grace; 
The Duke is coming; see the barge be ready; 
The greatness of his person. 
Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying 
Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name, and all 
For ever from the world. I had my trial, 
The least rub in your fortunes, fall away 
Pray for me! I must now forsake ye; the last hour 
That were the authors. 
SECOND GENTLEMAN. If the Duke be guiltless, 
Between the King and Katharine? 
For when the King once heard it, out of anger 
He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight 
To stop the rumour and allay those tongues 
The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal

SUFFOLK. How is the King employ'd? 
NORFOLK. What's the cause? 
CHAMBERLAIN. It seems the marriage with his brother's wife 
This is the Cardinal's doing; the King-Cardinal, 
That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune, 
Turns what he list. The King will know him one day. 
And with what zeal! For, now he has crack'd the league 
Between us and the Emperor, the Queen's great nephew, 
He dives into the King's soul and there scatters 
Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience, 
And out of all these to restore the King, 
That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls, 
Will bless the King-and is not this course pious? 
The French King's sister. Heaven will one day open 
The King's eyes, that so long have slept upon 
If the King please; his curses and his blessings 
Touch me alike; th' are breath I not believe in. 
And with some other business put the King 
The King has sent me otherwhere; besides, 
Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN; and the KING draws 
the curtain and sits reading pensively 
The quiet of my wounded conscience, 
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom.

The trial just and noble. All the clerks, 
I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms 
Have their free voices. Rome the nurse of judgment, 
And thank the holy conclave for their loves.

So many courses of the sun enthroned, 
Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which

The action of good women; there is hope 
Ta'en of your many virtues, the King's Majesty 
I shall not fail t' approve the fair conceit 
The King hath of you. [Aside] I have perus'd her well: 
That they have caught the King; and who knows yet 
To lighten all this isle?-I'll to the King 
For all the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it?

the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY alone; after him, the BISHOPS OF LINCOLN, ELY, 
follows a GENTLEMAN bearing the purse, with the great seal, 
after them, side by side, the two CARDINALS, WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS; 
two NOBLEMEN with the sword and mace. Then enter the KING and QUEEN 
and their trains. The KING takes place under the cloth of state; 
the two CARDINALS sit under him as judges. The QUEEN takes place 
some distance from the KING. The BISHOPS place themselves on each side 
of the court, in manner of consistory; below them the SCRIBES. 
The LORDS sit next the BISHOPS. The rest of the attendants stand 
in convenient order about the stage 
KING. What's the need? 
And on all sides th' authority allow'd; 
SCRIBE. Say 'Henry King of England, come into the court.' 
SCRIBE. Say 'Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.' 
The QUEEN makes no answer, rises out of her chair, 
goes about the court, comes to the KING, and kneels 
As I saw it inclin'd. When was the hour 
He was from thence discharg'd? Sir, call to mind 
With many children by you. If, in the course 
Turn me away and let the foul'st contempt 
To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you, sir, 
The King, your father, was reputed for 
The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many 
I will implore. If not, i' th' name of God, 
Yea, the elect o' th' land, who are assembled 
That longer you desire the court, as well 
What is unsettled in the King. 
The daughter of a king, my drops of tears 
Have stood to charity and display'd th' effects 
By a commission from the Consistory, 
Yea, the whole Consistory of Rome. You charge me 
The King is present; if it be known to him 
It lies to cure me, and the cure is to 
Remove these thoughts from you; the which before 
Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,

CRIER. Katharine Queen of England, come into the court. 
When you are call'd, return. Now the Lord help! 
That man i' th' world who shall report he has 
The queen of earthly queens. She's noble born; 
Induce you to the question on't, or ever 
A royal lady, spake one the least word that might 
Be to the prejudice of her present state, 
The Queen is put in anger. Y'are excus'd. 
Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desir'd 
The passages made toward it. On my honour, 
Then mark th' inducement. Thus it came-give heed to't: 
By th' Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador, 
Who had been hither sent on the debating 
A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and 
Our daughter Mary. I' th' progress of this business, 
I mean the Bishop-did require a respite 
Wherein he might the King his lord advertise 
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager, 
The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me, 
The region of my breast, which forc'd such way 
I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had 
The grave does to the dead; for her male issue 
Well worthy the best heir o' th' world, should not 
I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in 
The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer 
By all the reverend fathers of the land 
The question did at first so stagger me- 
The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt, 
For no dislike i' th' world against the person 
Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points 
Katharine our queen, before the primest creature 
That's paragon'd o' th' world. 
The Queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness 
Made to the Queen to call back her appeal

Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it! 
I am the most unhappy woman living. 
Almost no grave allow'd me. Like the My, 
That once was mistress of the field, and flourish'd,

Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him-

This paper has undone me. 'Tis th' account

Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To th' Pope.' 
The letter, as I live, with all the business 
I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness, 
Like a bright exhalation in the evening, 
Re-enter to WOLSEY the DUKES OF NORFOLK and 
SUFFOLK, the EARL OF SURREY, and the LORD 
NORFOLK. Hear the King's pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you 
To render up the great seal presently 
Bearing the King's will from his mouth expressly? 
You ask with such a violence, the King- 
Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours, 
SURREY. The King, that gave it. 
The heads of all thy brother cardinals, 
Far from his succour, from the King, from all 
That might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him; 
I answer is most false. The Duke by law 
That in the way of loyalty and truth 
Toward the King, my ever royal master, 
My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords 
Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one, 
The goodness of your intercepted packets 
You writ to th' Pope against the King; your goodness, 
As you respect the common good, the state 
Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles 
Worse than the sacring bell, when the brown wench 
NORFOLK. Those articles, my lord, are in the King's hand; 
When the King knows my truth. 
First, that without the King's assent or knowledge 
You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops. 
Was still inscrib'd; in which you brought the King 
SUFFOLK. Then, that without the knowledge 
Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold 
To carry into Flanders the great seal. 
Without the King's will or the state's allowance, 
Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King's coin. 
To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways 
You have for dignities, to the mere undoing 
Of all the kingdom. Many more there are, 
His faults lie open to the laws; let them, 
SUFFOLK. Lord Cardinal, the King's further pleasure is- 
Fall into th' compass of a praemunire- 
Out of the King's protection. This is my charge. 
About the giving back the great seal to us, 
The King shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you. 
WOLSEY. So farewell to the little good you bear me. 
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth 
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms 
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost, 
Weary and old with service, to the mercy 
A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur'd me, 
CROMWELL. The heaviest and the worst 
Is your displeasure with the King. 
CROMWELL. The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen 
CROMWELL. Last, that the Lady Anne, 
Whom the King hath in secrecy long married, 
Going to chapel; and the voice is now 
WOLSEY. There was the weight that pull'd me down. 
The King has gone beyond me. All my glories 
Or gild again the noble troops that waited 
To be thy lord and master. Seek the King; 
The King shall have my service; but my prayers 
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman. 
Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory, 
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour, 
By that sin fell the angels. How can man then, 
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it? 
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's, 
Serve the King, and-prithee lead me in. 
To the last penny; 'tis the King's. My robe, 
Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal 
The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwell. Exeunt

THIRD GENTLEMAN. As well as I am able. The rich stream 
Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen 
To a prepar'd place in the choir, fell of 
The beauty of her person to the people. 
Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman 
That ever lay by man; which when the people 
Had the full view of, such a noise arose 
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest, 
In the old time of war, would shake the press, 
Came to the altar, where she kneel'd, and saintlike 
Then rose again, and bow'd her to the people; 
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury 
She had all the royal makings of a queen: 
The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems 
Laid nobly on her; which perform'd, the choir, 
With all the choicest music of the kingdom, 
And with the same full state pac'd back again

face, for, o' my conscience, twenty of the dog-days now 
reign in's nose; all that stand about him are under the line, 
times on the head, and three times was his nose discharged 
for kindling such a combustion in the state. I miss'd the 
to her succour, which were the hope o' th' Strand, where 
At length they came to th' broomstaff to me; I defied 'em 
mine honour in and let 'em win the work: the devil was 
PORTER. These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse 
and fight for bitten apples; that no audience but the tribulation 
of Tower-hill or the limbs of Limehouse, their dear 
besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come. 
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN 
Your faithful friends o' th' suburbs? We shall have 
Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies, 
When they pass back from the christening. 
If the King blame me for't, I'll lay ye an 
By th' heels, and suddenly; and on your heads 
Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound; 
Th' are come already from the christening. 
Go break among the press and find a way out 
To let the troops pass fairly, or I'll find 
PORTER. Make way there for the Princess. 
PORTER. You i' th' camlet, get up o' th' rail; 
I'll peck you o'er the pales else. Exeunt 
The palace 
two Noblemen bearing great standing-bowls for the christening gifts; 
then four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the DUCHESS OF NORFOLK, 
godmother, bearing the CHILD richly habited in a mantle, etc., 
train borne by a LADY; then follows the MARCHIONESS DORSET, 
the other godmother, and LADIES. The troop pass once about the stage, 
life, long and ever-happy, to the high and mighty 
CRANMER. [Kneeling] And to your royal Grace and the 
KING. Stand up, lord. [The KING kisses the child] 
For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter 
With all the virtues that attend the good, 
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours. 
From her shall read the perfect ways of honour, 
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix 
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour 
That were the servants to this chosen infant, 
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine, 
His honour and the greatness of his name 
To all the plains about him; our children's children 
CRANMER. She shall be, to the happiness of England, 
She must, the saints must have her-yet a virgin; 
To th' ground, and all the world shall mourn her. 
And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords; 
Ye must all see the Queen, and she must thank ye, 
THE EPILOGUE. 
They'll say 'tis nought; others to hear the city 
All the expected good w'are like to hear 
The merciful construction of good women; 
All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap

CHATILLON. Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France 
In my behaviour to the majesty, 
The borrowed majesty, of England here. 
KING JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy. 
To this fair island and the territories, 
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword 
And put the same into young Arthur's hand, 
CHATILLON. The proud control of fierce and bloody war, 
The farthest limit of my embassy. 
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France; 
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard. 
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath 
Till she had kindled France and all the world 
Upon the right and party of her son? 
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must 
ESSEX. My liege, here is the strangest controversy 
Come from the country to be judg'd by you 
That e'er I heard. Shall I produce the men? 
A soldier by the honour-giving hand 
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field. 
ROBERT. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge. 
KING JOHN. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir? 
But for the certain knowledge of that truth 
The which if he can prove, 'a pops me out 
BASTARD. I know not why, except to get the land. 
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!- 
The accent of his tongue affecteth him. 
In the large composition of this man? 
To Germany, there with the Emperor 
Th' advantage of his absence took the King, 
And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's; 
And if he were, he came into the world 
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time. 
And if she did play false, the fault was hers; 
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands 
This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world; 
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion, 
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death. 
BASTARD. Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand; 
Now blessed be the hour, by night or day, 
ELINOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet! 
Something about, a little from the right, 
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch; 
For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty. 
Exeunt all but the BASTARD 
But many a many foot of land the worse. 
And talking of the Alps and Apennines, 
The Pyrenean and the river Po- 
And fits the mounting spirit like myself; 
For he is but a bastard to the time 
But from the inward motion to deliver 
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth; 
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising. 
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man? 
BASTARD. As faithfully as I deny the devil. 
Thou art the issue of my dear offence, 
The aweless lion could not wage the fight 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Enter, on one side, AUSTRIA and forces; on the other, KING PHILIP OF FRANCE, 
LEWIS the Dauphin, CONSTANCE, ARTHUR, and forces 
Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart 
And fought the holy wars in Palestine, 
And to rebuke the usurpation 
The rather that you give his offspring life, 
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke. 
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France, 
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides 
Even till that England, hedg'd in with the main, 
Even till that utmost corner of the west 
AUSTRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords 
Against the brows of this resisting town; 
To cull the plots of best advantages. 
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood, 
Hath put himself in arms. The adverse winds, 
With him along is come the mother-queen, 
With her the Lady Blanch of Spain; 
With them a bastard of the king's deceas'd; 
And all th' unsettled humours of the land- 
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er 
Did never float upon the swelling tide 
The interruption of their churlish drums 
Enter KING JOHN, ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD, 
Cut off the sequence of posterity, 
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown. 
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time 
And this is Geffrey's. In the name of God, 
Which owe the crown that thou o'er-masterest? 
To look into the blots and stains of right. 
That thou mayst be a queen and check the world! 
BASTARD. Hear the crier. 
AUSTRIA. What the devil art thou? 
BASTARD. One that will play the devil, sir, with you, 
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes, 
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard; 
That did disrobe the lion of that robe! 
BASTARD. It lies as sightly on the back of him 
King John, this is the very sum of all: 
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win. 
The dominations, royalties, and rights, 
The canon of the law is laid on him, 
Being but the second generation 
But God hath made her sin and her the plague 
Her injury the beadle to her sin; 
All punish'd in the person of this child, 
A will that bars the title of thy son. 
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls 
Trumpet sounds. Enter citizens upon the walls 
CITIZEN. Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls? 
Before the eye and prospect of your town, 
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath, 
By the compulsion of their ordinance 
But on the sight of us your lawful king, 
Behold, the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle; 
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right 
Son to the elder brother of this man, 
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal 
In the relief of this oppressed child 
Against th' invulnerable clouds of heaven; 
'Tis not the roundure of your old-fac'd walls 
Or shall we give the signal to our rage, 
CITIZEN. In brief: we are the King of England's subjects; 
KING JOHN. Acknowledge then the King, and let me in. 
CITIZEN. That can we not; but he that proves the King, 
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world. 
KING JOHN. Doth not the crown of England prove the King? 
We for the worthiest hold the right from both. 
KING JOHN. Then God forgive the sin of all those souls 
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet 
BASTARD. Saint George, that swing'd the dragon, and e'er since 
BASTARD. O, tremble, for you hear the lion roar! 
KING JOHN. Up higher to the plain, where we'll set forth 
BASTARD. Speed then to take advantage of the field. 
KING PHILIP. It shall be so; and at the other hill 
Command the rest to stand. God and our right! Exeunt 
Here, after excursions, enter the HERALD OF FRANCE, 
with trumpets, to the gates 
Who by the hand of France this day hath made 
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground; 
Coldly embracing the discoloured earth; 
Upon the dancing banners of the French, 
Dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes. 
Open your gates and give the victors way. 
From first to last the onset and retire 
Enter the two KINGS, with their powers, at several doors 
Say, shall the current of our right run on? 
A peaceful progress to the ocean. 
That sways the earth this climate overlooks, 
Or add a royal number to the dead, 
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss 
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings. 
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire! 
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs; 
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men, 
Cry 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field, 
The other's peace. Till then, blows, blood, and death! 
KING JOHN. Whose party do the townsmen yet admit? 
CITIZEN. The King of England, when we know the King. 
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem, 
Their battering cannon, charged to the mouths, 
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city. 
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air. 
To whom in favour she shall give the day, 
Smacks it not something of the policy? 
KING JOHN. Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads, 
And lay this Angiers even with the ground; 
BASTARD. An if thou hast the mettle of a king, 
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery, 
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground, 
KING JOHN. We from the west will send destruction 
AUSTRIA. I from the north. 
KING PHILIP. Our thunder from the south 
That here come sacrifices for the field. 
CITIZEN. That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch, 
Is niece to England; look upon the years 
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid. 
Is the young Dauphin every way complete- 
He is the half part of a blessed man, 
Do glorify the banks that bound them in; 
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope 
The sea enraged is not half so deaf, 
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death 
He gives the bastinado with his tongue; 
Thy now unsur'd assurance to the crown 
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit. 
I see a yielding in the looks of France; 
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath 
CITIZEN. Why answer not the double majesties 
KING JOHN. If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son, 
And all that we upon this side the sea- 
Holds hand with any princess of the world. 
KING PHILIP. What say'st thou, boy? Look in the lady's face. 
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye; 
Which, being but the shadow of your son, 
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye. 
BASTARD. [Aside] Drawn in the flattering table of her eye, 
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow, 
The rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd. 
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop? 
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance; 
If not fill up the measure of her will, 
Exeunt all but the BASTARD 
John, to stop Arthur's tide in the whole, 
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field 
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear 
That broker that still breaks the pate of faith, 
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that; 
Commodity, the bias of the world- 
The world, who of itself is peised well, 
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France, 
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand 
Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich. 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
France. The FRENCH KING'S camp 
Is but the vain breath of a common man: 
I have a king's oath to the contrary. 
As doth the fury of two desperate men 
Which in the very meeting fall and die! 
But spoke the harm that is by others done? 
And with the half-blown rose; but Fortune, O! 
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs. 
I may not go without you to the kings. 
To me, and to the state of my great grief, 
That no supporter but the huge firm earth 
Can hold it up. [Seats herself on the ground] 
ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and attendants 
To solemnize this day the glorious sun 
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist, 
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold. 
The yearly course that brings this day about 
Among the high tides in the calendar? 
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week, 
To curse the fair proceedings of this day. 
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war 
Let not the hours of this ungodly day 
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset, 
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side! 
KING PHILIP. Here comes the holy legate of the Pope. 
And from Pope Innocent the legate here, 
Why thou against the Church, our holy mother, 
Can task the free breath of a sacred king? 
To charge me to an answer, as the Pope. 
Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England 
Without th' assistance of a mortal hand. 
So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart 
KING JOHN. Though you and all the kings of Christendom 
Dreading the curse that money may buy out, 
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust, 
Though you and all the rest, so grossly led, 
Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes. 
PANDULPH. Then by the lawful power that I have 
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law; 
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse? 
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic, 
And raise the power of France upon his head, 
AUSTRIA. King Philip, listen to the Cardinal. 
KING JOHN. Philip, what say'st thou to the Cardinal? 
CONSTANCE. What should he say, but as the Cardinal? 
LEWIS. Bethink you, father; for the difference 
Or the light loss of England for a friend. 
Forgo the easier. 
BLANCH. That's the curse of Rome. 
CONSTANCE. O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here 
BLANCH. The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith, 
Which only lives but by the death of faith, 
KING JOHN. The King is mov'd, and answers not to this. 
And the conjunction of our inward souls 
The latest breath that gave the sound of words 
The fearful difference of incensed kings. 
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed 
And make a riot on the gentle brow 
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse- 
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue, 
A chafed lion by the mortal paw, 
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth, 
That is, to be the champion of our Church. 
The truth is then most done not doing it; 
The better act of purposes mistook 
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd. 
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st, 
And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth 
Against an oath; the truth thou art unsure 
The peril of our curses fight on thee 
But in despair die under the black weight. 
Against the blood that thou hast married? 
Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom 
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife? 
BASTARD. Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time, 
BLANCH. The sun's o'ercast with blood. Fair day, adieu! 
Which is the side that I must go withal? 
Father, I may not wish the fortune thine; 
Assured loss before the match be play'd. 
The blood, and dearest-valu'd blood, of France. 
Alarums, excursions. Enter the BASTARD with AUSTRIA'S head 
Some airy devil hovers in the sky 
the BASTARD, HUBERT, and LORDS 
KING JOHN. [To the BASTARD] Cousin, away for England! haste 
And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags 
Set at liberty; the fat ribs of peace 
Must by the hungry now be fed upon. 
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day, 
Attended with the pleasures of the world, 
To give me audience. If the midnight bell 
Sound on into the drowsy race of night; 
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins, 
France. The FRENCH KING's camp 
KING PHILIP. So by a roaring tempest on the flood 
Holding th' eternal spirit, against her will, 
In the vile prison of afflicted breath. 
CONSTANCE. Lo now! now see the issue of your peace! 
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night, 
O that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth! 
Then with a passion would I shake the world, 
The different plague of each calamity. 
In the fair multitude of those her hairs! 
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child, 
And chase the native beauty from his cheek, 
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven 
CONSTANCE. Grief fills the room up of my absent child, 
My life, my joy, my food, my ail the world! 
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man; 
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste, 
PANDULPH. Before the curing of a strong disease, 
Even in the instant of repair and health, 
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave 
For even the breath of what I mean to speak 
Out of the path which shall directly lead 
The misplac'd John should entertain an hour, 
PANDULPH. You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife, 
May then make all the claim that Arthur did. 
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you; 
This act, so evilly borne, shall cool the hearts 
No natural exhalation in the sky, 
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts 
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change, 
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of john. 
Than I have nam'd! The bastard Faulconbridge 
Is now in England ransacking the Church, 
Go with me to the King. 'Tis wonderful 
For England go; I will whet on the King. 
If you say ay, the King will not say no. Exeunt 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Within the arras. When I strike my foot 
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth 
And bind the boy which you shall find with me 
Fast to the chair. Be heedful; hence, and watch. 
EXECUTIONER. I hope your warrant will bear out the deed. 
I should be as merry as the day is long; 
ARTHUR. Have you the heart? When your head did but ache, 
The best I had, a princess wrought it me- 
And, like the watchful minutes to the hour, 
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time, 
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot, 
Even in the matter of mine innocence; 
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men. 
HUBERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here. 
Nor look upon the iron angrily; 
ARTHUR. Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues 
Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold 
ARTHUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief, 
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out, 
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes. 
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world, 
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt; 
Fresh expectation troubled not the land 
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily, 
To throw a perfume on the violet, 
To smooth the ice, or add another hue 
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light 
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish, 
And, in the last repeating, troublesome, 
SALISBURY. In this the antique and well-noted face 
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about, 
Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse, 
Discredit more in hiding of the fault 
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd. 
PEMBROKE. Then I, as one that am the tongue of these, 
To sound the purposes of all their hearts, 
Your safety, for the which myself and them 
Th' enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint 
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent 
The steps of wrong-should move you to mew up 
The rich advantage of good exercise? 
That the time's enemies may not have this 
PEMBROKE. This is the man should do the bloody deed: 
The image of a wicked heinous fault 
Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast, 
SALISBURY. The colour of the King doth come and go 
PEMBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence 
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death. 
The suit which you demand is gone and dead: 
Before the child himself felt he was sick. 
Think you I bear the shears of destiny? 
Have I commandment on the pulse of life? 
And find th' inheritance of this poor child, 
That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle 
Three foot of it doth hold-bad world the while! 
Was levied in the body of a land. 
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them, 
The tidings comes that they are all arriv'd. 
Is stopp'd with dust: the first of April died 
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died 
MESSENGER. Under the Dauphin. 
Enter the BASTARD and PETER OF POMFRET 
Now! What says the world 
BASTARD. But if you be afear'd to hear the worst, 
Then let the worst, unheard, fall on your head. 
Under the tide; but now I breathe again 
Aloft the flood, and can give audience 
BASTARD. How I have sped among the clergymen 
The sums I have collected shall express. 
But as I travell'd hither through the land, 
I find the people strangely fantasied; 
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found 
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon, 
PETER. Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so. 
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arriv'd? 
BASTARD. The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it; 
And others more, going to seek the grave 
KING JOHN. Nay, but make haste; the better foot before. 
BASTARD. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed. 
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers; 
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about 
The other four in wondrous motion. 
HUBERT. Old men and beldams in the streets 
And whisper one another in the ear; 
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist, 
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool, 
KING JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be attended 
To break within the bloody house of life, 
And on the winking of authority 
To understand a law; to know the meaning 
KING JOHN. O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth 
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds 
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd, 
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name. 
Nay, in the body of the fleshly land, 
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood. 
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought 
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind 
KING JOHN. Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers, 
Forgive the comment that my passion made 
The angry lords with all expedient haste. 
England. Before the castle 
Enter ARTHUR, on the walls 
ARTHUR. The wall is high, and yet will I leap down. 
This gentle offer of the perilous time. 
PEMBROKE. Who brought that letter from the Cardinal? 
SALISBURY. The Count Melun, a noble lord of France, 
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love 
Enter the BASTARD 
The King by me requests your presence straight. 
SALISBURY. The King hath dispossess'd himself of us. 
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot 
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks. 
Return and tell him so. We know the worst. 
SALISBURY. This is the prison. What is he lies here? 
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed. 
Form such another? This is the very top, 
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest, 
Of murder's arms; this is the bloodiest shame, 
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke, 
Presented to the tears of soft remorse. 
To the yet unbegotten sin of times, 
The graceless action of a heavy hand, 
If that it be the work of any hand. 
SALISBURY. If that it be the work of any hand! 
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand; 
The practice and the purpose of the King; 
The incense of a vow, a holy vow, 
Never to taste the pleasures of the world, 
By giving it the worship of revenge. 
Arthur doth live; the King hath sent for you. 
SALISBURY. Must I rob the law? [Drawing his sword] 
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence; 
BASTARD. Keep the peace, I say. 
BASTARD. Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury. 
That you shall think the devil is come from hell. 
Th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house; 
BIGOT. Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there! 
PEMBROKE. There tell the King he may inquire us out. 
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach 
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread 
And it shall be as all the ocean, 
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath 
Among the thorns and dangers of this world. 
The life, the right, and truth of all this realm 
To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth 
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state. 
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty 
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace; 
The imminent decay of wrested pomp. 
And follow me with speed. I'll to the King; 
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land. Exeunt 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
The circle of my glory. 
PANDULPH. [Gives back the crown] Take again 
From this my hand, as holding of the Pope, 
KING JOHN. Now keep your holy word; go meet the French; 
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul 
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick 
Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope; 
Upon your oath of service to the Pope, 
Go I to make the French lay down their arms. Exit 
KING JOHN. Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet 
Enter the BASTARD 
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers. 
The little number of your doubtful friends. 
BASTARD. They found him dead, and cast into the streets, 
An empty casket, where the jewel of life 
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust 
Govern the motion of a kingly eye. 
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire; 
Threaten the threat'ner, and outface the brow 
That borrow their behaviours from the great, 
The dauntless spirit of resolution. 
Away, and glister like the god of war 
When he intendeth to become the field; 
What, shall they seek the lion in his den, 
To meet displeasure farther from the doors 
KING JOHN. The legate of the Pope hath been with me, 
And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers 
Led by the Dauphin. 
Shall we, upon the footing of our land, 
Mocking the air with colours idly spread, 
Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace; 
KING JOHN. Have thou the ordering of this present time. 
England. The DAUPHIN'S camp at Saint Edmundsbury 
Return the precedent to these lords again, 
May know wherefore we took the sacrament, 
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound 
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury! 
But such is the infection of the time 
That, for the health and physic of our right, 
We cannot deal but with the very hand 
That we, the sons and children of this isle, 
Upon the spot of this enforced cause- 
To grace the gentry of a land remote 
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself 
The blood of malice in a vein of league, 
This show'r, blown up by tempest of the soul, 
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven 
That never saw the giant world enrag'd, 
Into the purse of rich prosperity 
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine. 
Look where the holy legate comes apace, 
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven 
And on our actions set the name of right 
The next is this: King John hath reconcil'd 
That so stood out against the holy Church, 
The great metropolis and see of Rome. 
And tame the savage spirit of wild war, 
It may lie gently at the foot of peace 
To any sovereign state throughout the world. 
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars 
You taught me how to know the face of right, 
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed, 
Have I not here the best cards for the game 
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set? 
PANDULPH. You look but on the outside of this work. 
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world 
Even in the jaws of danger and of death. 
Enter the BASTARD, attended 
BASTARD. According to the fair play of the world, 
My holy lord of Milan, from the King 
And, as you answer, I do know the scope 
PANDULPH. The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite, 
BASTARD. By all the blood that ever fury breath'd, 
The youth says well. Now hear our English King; 
The King doth smile at; and is well prepar'd 
From out the circle of his territories. 
That hand which had the strength, even at your door. 
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch, 
Even at the crying of your nation's crow, 
No. Know the gallant monarch is in arms 
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb 
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war, 
And echo with the clamour of thy drum, 
As loud as thine, rattle the welkin's ear 
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder; for at hand- 
To feast upon whole thousands of the French. 
England. The field of battle 
KING JOHN. How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert. 
Desires your Majesty to leave the field 
KING JOHN. Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there. 
MESSENGER. Be of good comfort; for the great supply 
That was expected by the Dauphin here 
The French fight coldly, and retire themselves. 
England. Another part of the battlefield 
SALISBURY. I did not think the King so stor'd with friends. 
PEMBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French; 
In spite of spite, alone upholds the day. 
PEMBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field. 
MELUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here. 
PEMBROKE. It is the Count Melun. 
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion, 
For if the French be lords of this loud day, 
He means to recompense the pains you take 
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury; 
Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire? 
What in the world should make me now deceive, 
Since I must lose the use of all deceit? 
I say again, if Lewis do will the day, 
Behold another day break in the east; 
Already smokes about the burning crest 
Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun, 
Paying the fine of rated treachery 
If Lewis by your assistance win the day. 
The love of him-and this respect besides, 
From forth the noise and rumour of the field, 
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts 
But I do love the favour and the form 
Of this most fair occasion, by the which 
We will untread the steps of damned flight, 
For I do see the cruel pangs of death 
England. The French camp 
LEWIS. The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set, 
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush, 
Last in the field and almost lords of it! 
MESSENGER. Where is my prince, the Dauphin? 
MESSENGER. The Count Melun is slain; the English lords 
The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs? 
The day shall not be up so soon as I 
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow. Exeunt 
Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT, severally 
HUBERT. Of the part of England. 
I come one way of the Plantagenets. 
Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear. 
HUBERT. Why, here walk I in the black brow of night 
BASTARD. Brief, then; and what's the news? 
HUBERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night, 
BASTARD. Show me the very wound of this ill news; 
HUBERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk; 
The better arm you to the sudden time 
Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King 
HUBERT. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back, 
At whose request the King hath pardon'd them, 
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide- 
Away, before! conduct me to the King; 
The orchard at Swinstead Abbey 
PRINCE HENRY. It is too late; the life of all his blood 
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house, 
Doth by the idle comments that it makes 
Foretell the ending of mortality. 
That, being brought into the open air, 
It would allay the burning quality 
PRINCE HENRY. Let him be brought into the orchard here. 
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts, 
Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds 
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan 
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings 
And none of you will bid the winter come 
Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north 
KING JOHN. The salt in them is hot. 
Within me is a hell; and there the poison 
Enter the BASTARD 
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burnt, 
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail 
BASTARD. The Dauphin is preparing hitherward, 
For in a night the best part of my pow'r, 
Were in the Washes all unwarily 
Devoured by the unexpected flood. [The KING dies] 
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay, 
To do the office for thee of revenge, 
Out of the weak door of our fainting land. 
The Dauphin rages at our very heels. 
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest, 
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin, 
BASTARD. He will the rather do it when he sees 
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel 
To the disposing of the Cardinal; 
The lineal state and glory of the land! 
SALISBURY. And the like tender of our love we make, 
BASTARD. O, let us pay the time but needful woe, 
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror, 
Come the three corners of the world in arms,

SCENE: Rome, the conspirators' camp near Sardis, and the plains of Philippi. 
Upon a laboring day without the sign 
SECOND COMMONER. Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the awl; I 
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets? 
The livelong day with patient expectation 
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome. 
To hear the replication of your sounds 
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague 
Assemble all the poor men of your sort, 
Into the channel, till the lowest stream 
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all. 
Go you down that way towards the Capitol; 
This way will I. Disrobe the images 
You know it is the feast of Lupercal. 
And drive away the vulgar from the streets; 
Who else would soar above the view of men 
Flourish. Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia, Portia, 
The barren, touched in this holy chase, 
CAESAR. Who is it in the press that calls on me? 
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, 
SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March. 
BRUTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March. 
CASSIUS. Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar. 
SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March. 
CASSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course? 
I turn the trouble of my countenance 
Forgets the shows of love to other men. 
BRUTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself 
Where many of the best respect in Rome, 
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. 
BRUTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people 
If it be aught toward the general good, 
Set honor in one eye and death i' the other 
For let the gods so speed me as I love 
The name of honor more than I fear death. 
Well, honor is the subject of my story. 
Endure the winter's cold as well as he. 
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, 
And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word, 
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it 
But ere we could arrive the point proposed, 
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder 
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber 
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man 
And when the fit was on him I did mark 
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world 
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans 
So get the start of the majestic world 
And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. 
CASSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world 
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, 
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; 
Now, in the names of all the gods at once, 
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! 
When went there by an age since the great flood 
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome 
BRUTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. 
CASSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, 
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow, 
And all the rest look like a chidden train: 
As we have seen him in the Capitol, 
CASSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is. 
I do not know the man I should avoid 
Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, 
CASCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me? 
he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the 
BRUTUS. What was the second noise for? 
CASSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? 
BRUTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice? 
CASSIUS. Who offered him the crown? 
BRUTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. 
CASCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was 
the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he 
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands 
stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had 
and receiving the bad air. 
CASCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was 
BRUTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness. 
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. 
down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him 
the players in the theatre, I am no true man. 
CASCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common 
herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet 
might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came 
CASCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face 
the eating. 
CASSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. 
Writings, all tending to the great opinion 
CASCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth 
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds 
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen 
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam 
To be exalted with the threatening clouds, 
Or else the world too saucy with the gods 
Against the Capitol I met a lion, 
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets. 
And yesterday the bird of night did sit 
Even at noonday upon the marketplace, 
Unto the climate that they point upon. 
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. 
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow? 
CASCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so? 
CASSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults. 
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets, 
Submitting me unto the perilous night, 
Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone; 
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open 
The breast of heaven, I did present myself 
Even in the aim and very flash of it. 
CASCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? 
It is the part of men to fear and tremble 
When the most mighty gods by tokens send 
To see the strange impatience of the heavens. 
But if you would consider the true cause 
As doth the lion in the Capitol, 
But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead, 
CASCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow 
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; 
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; 
If I know this, know all the world besides, 
The power to cancel his captivity. 
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep. 
For the base matter to illuminate 
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans 
There is no stir or walking in the streets, 
And the complexion of the element 
In favor's like the work we have in hand, 
But win the noble Brutus to our party- 
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair, 
Is ours already, and the man entire 
Upon the next encounter yields him ours. 
CASCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts, 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
I cannot, by the progress of the stars, 
But for the general. He would be crown'd: 
How that might change his nature, there's the question. 
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder 
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins 
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; 
But when he once attains the upmost round, 
He then unto the ladder turns his back, 
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees 
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel 
Will bear no color for the thing he is, 
And kill him in the shell. 
LUCIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir. 
Searching the window for a flint I found 
Gives him the letter. 
Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March? 
BRUTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word. 
BRUTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air 
Opens the letter and reads. 
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome 
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king. 
If the redress will follow, thou receivest 
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus! 
BRUTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks. 
Between the acting of a dreadful thing 
And the first motion, all the interim is 
The genius and the mortal instruments 
Are then in council, and the state of man, 
The nature of an insurrection. 
LUCIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door, 
They are the faction. O Conspiracy, 
Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, 
DECIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here? 
That fret the clouds are messengers of day. 
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, 
Which is a great way growing on the south, 
Weighing the youthful season of the year. 
Some two months hence up higher toward the north 
He first presents his fire, and the high east 
Stands as the Capitol, directly here. 
BRUTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men, 
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse- 
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, 
Than secret Romans that have spoke the word 
The even virtue of our enterprise, 
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits, 
If he do break the smallest particle 
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs 
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, 
And in the spirit of men there is no blood. 
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, 
Which so appearing to the common eyes, 
For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar- 
BRUTUS. Peace, count the clock. 
CASSIUS. The clock hath stricken three. 
Quite from the main opinion he held once 
The unaccustom'd terror of this night, 
And the persuasion of his augurers 
May hold him from the Capitol today. 
For I can give his humor the true bent, 
And I will bring him to the Capitol. 
BRUTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most? 
CINNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then. 
CASSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus, 
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber; 
Which busy care draws in the brains of men; 
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning. 
And when I ask'd you what the matter was, 
He would embrace the means to come by it. 
To walk unbraced and suck up the humors 
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick, 
To dare the vile contagion of the night 
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air 
Which by the right and virtue of my place 
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, 
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs 
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops 
Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience 
The secrets of my heart. 
All the charactery of my sad brows. 
Any exploit worthy the name of honor. 
LIGARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before, 
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do? 
CAESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, 
CAESAR. Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me 
The face of Caesar, they are vanished. 
Besides the things that we have heard and seen, 
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. 
A lioness hath whelped in the streets; 
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds, 
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol; 
The noise of battle hurtled in the air, 
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. 
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? 
Are to the world in general as to Caesar. 
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. 
The valiant never taste of death but once. 
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, 
What say the augurers? 
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, 
They could not find a heart within the beast. 
CAESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice. 
And I the elder and more terrible. 
That keeps you in the house and not your own. 
We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House, 
I come to fetch you to the Senate House. 
To bear my greeting to the senators 
To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth? 
CAESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come, 
That is enough to satisfy the Senate. 
And know it now, the Senate have concluded 
"Break up the Senate till another time, 
BRUTUS. [Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar, 
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon! Exeunt.

about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods 
Out of the teeth of emulation. 
If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive. Exit. 
Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus. 
PORTIA. I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House; 
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else? 
And the wind brings it from the Capitol. 
Enter the Soothsayer. 
SOOTHSAYER. About the ninth hour, lady. 
PORTIA. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol? 
To see him pass on to the Capitol. 
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow, 
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, 
The heart of woman is! O Brutus, 
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise! 
Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit

Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above. 
A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer. 
CAESAR. The ides of March are come. 
CAESAR. What, is the fellow mad? 
CASSIUS. What, urge you your petitions in the street? 
Come to the Capitol. 
Caesar goes up to the Senate House, the rest follow. 
He draws Mark Antony out of the way. 
CINNA. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. 
Might fire the blood of ordinary men 
Into the law of children. Be not fond 
That will be thaw'd from the true quality 
For the repealing of my banish'd brother? 
But I am constant as the northern star, 
There is no fellow in the firmament. 
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks; 
So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men, 
Yet in the number I do know but one 
Casca first, then the other Conspirators 
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. 
CASSIUS. Some to the common pulpits and cry out 
CASCA. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. 
CASSIUS. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people 
But we the doers. 
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time 
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords; 
Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, 
No worthier than the dust! 
So often shall the knot of us be call'd 
The men that gave their country liberty. 
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. 
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus 
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state 
Falls shrewdly to the purpose. 
With the most noble blood of all this world. 
The choice and master spirits of this age. 
And this the bleeding business they have done. 
And pity to the general wrong of Rome- 
In the disposing of new dignities. 
The multitude, beside themselves with fear, 
And then we will deliver you the cause 
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes, 
Most noble! In the presence of thy corse? 
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, 
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee. 
The enemies of Caesar shall say this: 
Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar. 
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, 
Produce his body to the marketplace, 
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, 
Speak in the order of his funeral. 
Know you how much the people may be moved 
I will myself into the pulpit first, 
And show the reason of our Caesar's death. 
In the same pulpit whereto I am going, 
BRUTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us. 
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man 
That ever lived in the tide of times. 
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! 
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) 
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; 
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; 
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war; 
Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war, 
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth 
O Caesar! Sees the body. 
Into the marketplace. There shall I try, 
In my oration, how the people take 
The cruel issue of these bloody men, 
According to the which thou shalt discourse 
To young Octavius of the state of things.

ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might

Let but the commons hear this testament- 
FOURTH CITIZEN. We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. 
ALL. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will. 
And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, 
FOURTH CITIZEN. Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony. 
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will. 
I fear I wrong the honorable men 
ALL. The will! The testament! 
SECOND CITIZEN. They were villains, murtherers. The will! 
Read the will! 
ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will? 
Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar, 
And let me show you him that made the will. 
He comes down from the pulpit. 
FIRST CITIZEN. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body. 
The first time ever Caesar put it on; 
That day he overcame the Nervii. 
See what a rent the envious Casca made; 
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd; 
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it, 
This was the most unkindest cut of all; 
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, 
Even at the base of Pompey's statue, 
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell. 
The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. 
FIRST CITIZEN. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. 
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech, 
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. 
FIRST CITIZEN. We'll burn the house of Brutus. 
THIRD CITIZEN. Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators. 
You have forgot the will I told you of. 
ALL. Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will. 
ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal. 
We'll burn his body in the holy place 
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses. 
Take up the body. 
Exeunt Citizens with the body. 
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. 
ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people, 
Enter Cinna the poet. 
CINNA. Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol. 
CINNA. I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet. 
CINNA. I am not Cinna the conspirator.

Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine 
OCTAVIUS. Or here, or at the Capitol. Exit Lepidus. 
The three-fold world divided, he should stand 
One of the three to share it? 
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, 
To groan and sweat under the business, 
Either led or driven, as we point the way; 
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears 
OCTAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake, 
LUCILIUS. Give the word, ho, and stand. 
But when they should endure the bloody spur, 
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on? 
The greater part, the horse in general, 
BRUTUS. Stand, ho! Speak the word along. 
Before the eyes of both our armies here, 
BRUTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man 
For taking bribes here of the Sardians, 
Because I knew the man, were slighted off. 
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last. 
BRUTUS. The name of Cassius honors this corruption, 
BRUTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember. 
That struck the foremost man of all this world 
And sell the mighty space of our large honors 
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, 
Under your testy humor? By the gods, 
You shall digest the venom of your spleen, 
That they pass by me as the idle wind 
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash 
For Cassius is aweary of the world: 
That carries anger as the flint bears fire, 
BRUTUS. What's the matter? 
POET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals. 
CASSIUS. How now, what's the matter? 
What should the wars do with these jigging fools? 
BRUTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders 
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup; 
MESSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure. 
MESSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell: 
I have the patience to endure it now. 
'Tis better that the enemy seek us; 
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground 
The enemy, marching along by them, 
That we have tried the utmost of our friends, 
The enemy increaseth every day; 
We, at the height, are ready to decline. 
There is a tide in the affairs of men 
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune; 
Omitted, all the voyage of their life 
And we must take the current when it serves, 
BRUTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk, 
This was an ill beginning of the night. 
Re-enter Lucius, with the gown. 
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?

The plains of Philippi. 
You said the enemy would not come down, 
But keep the hills and upper regions. 
The enemy comes on in gallant show; 
Upon the left hand of the even field. 
OCTAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left. 
Make forth, the generals would have some words. 
OCTAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal. 
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart, 
The posture of your blows are yet unknown; 
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees, 
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar. 
Strooke Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers! 
OCTAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat, 
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. 
When think you that the sword goes up again? 
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors. 
BRUTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, 
If you dare fight today, come to the field; 
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard. 
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. 
The gods today stand friendly that we may, 
But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain, 
Let's reason with the worst that may befall. 
The very last time we shall speak together. 
BRUTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy 
By which I did blame Cato for the death 
The time of life- arming myself with patience 
To stay the providence of some high powers 
Thorough the streets of Rome? 
Must end that work the ides of March begun. 
The end of this day's business ere it come! 
But it sufficeth that the day will end, 
And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away! Exeunt. 
The field of battle. 
Unto the legions on the other side. Loud alarum. 
And sudden push gives them the overthrow. 
Another part of the field. 
CASSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly! 
I slew the coward, and did take it from him. 
TITINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early, 
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire? 
And tell me what thou notest about the field. 
Pindarus ascends the hill. 
With horsemen, that make to him on the spur; 
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts; 
Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou art 
Even with the sword that kill'd thee. Dies. 
MESSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground? 
TITINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart! 
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone; 
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men 
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived, 
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee! 
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report 
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus 
And I will seek for Pindarus the while. Exit Messala. 
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well! 
And come, young Cato; let us to the field. 
Another part of the field. 
I will proclaim my name about the field. 
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! 
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! 
FIRST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general. 
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus; 
The gods defend him from so great a shame! 
Another part of the field. 
CLITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord, 
BRUTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word: 
CLITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world. 
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me 
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes; 
Our enemies have beat us to the pit; Low alarums. 
Lucilius, and the Army. 
STRATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala: 
The conquerors can but make a fire of him; 
STRATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it. 
That did the latest service to my master. 
ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all. 
All the conspirators, save only he, 
His life was gentle, and the elements 
And say to all the world, "This was a man!" 
So call the field to rest, and let's away, 
To part the glories of this happy day. Exeunt.

PRINCESS OF FRANCE. Was that the King that spurr'd his horse so 
Against the steep uprising of the hill? 
Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush 
That we must stand and play the murderer in? 
FORESTER. Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice; 
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot. 
And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot. 
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow. 
But come, the bow. Now mercy goes to kill, 
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:

The poor deer's blood that my heart means no ill.

NATHANIEL. Very reverent sport, truly; and done in the testimony of 
HOLOFERNES. The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe as 
the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo, 
the sky, the welkin, the heaven; and anon falleth like a crab on 
the face of terra, the soil, the land, the earth. 
NATHANIEL. Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly 
varied, like a scholar at the least; but, sir, I assure ye it was 
a buck of the first head. 
DULL. I Said the deer was not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket. 
NATHANIEL. Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in

Many can brook the weather that love not the wind. 
NATHANIEL. A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.

To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,

Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright 
Through the transparent bosom of the deep, 
Do but behold the tears that swell in me, 
How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper- 
BEROWNE. One drunkard loves another of the name. 
LONGAVILLE. Am I the first that have been perjur'd so? 
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society, 
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.

Through the velvet leaves the wind, 
That the lover, sick to death, 
Wish'd himself the heaven's breath. 
O, would the King, Berowne and Longaville, 
'Ay me!' says one. 'O Jove!' the other cries. 
One, her hairs were gold; crystal the other's eyes. 
For all the wealth that ever I did see, 
You found his mote; the King your mote did see; 
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys, 
And where my liege's? All about the breast.

At the first op'ning of the gorgeous east, 
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast? 
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow 
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty 
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues- 
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy. 
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine! 
KING. O paradox! Black is the badge of hell, 
The hue of dungeons, and the school of night; 
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well. 
Her favour turns the fashion of the days; 
BEROWNE. O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes, 
The street should see as she walk'd overhead. 
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil! 
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth. 
Have found the ground of study's excellence 
Without the beauty of a woman's face? 
They are the ground, the books, the academes, 
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire. 
The nimble spirits in the arteries, 
The sinewy vigour of the traveller. 
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes, 
And study too, the causer of your vow; 
For where is author in the world 
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes 
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain; 
Lives not alone immured in the brain, 
But with the motion of all elements 
It adds a precious seeing to the eye: 
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound, 
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd. 
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails: 
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides? 
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods 
Make heaven drowsy with the harmony. 
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire; 
They are the books, the arts, the academes, 
That show, contain, and nourish, all the world, 
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women; 
For charity itself fulfils the law,

Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face, 
Thou now requests but moonshine in the water. 
Not yet? No dance! Thus change I like the moon.

The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it. 
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends. 
LONGAVILLE. I know the reason, lady, why you ask. 
KATHARINE. 'Veal' quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?

As is the razor's edge invisible, 
Above the sense of sense; so sensible 
Are these the breed of wits so wondered at? 
The King was weeping-ripe for a good word. 
But will you hear? The King is my love sworn.

Re-enter the KING, BEROWNE, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, 
KING. Fair sir, God save you! Where's the Princess? 
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know, 
Have not the grace to grace it with such show. 
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve; 
This is the ape of form, Monsieur the Nice, 
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice 
Mend him who can. The ladies call him sweet; 
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet. 
This is the flow'r that smiles on every one, 
Pay him the due of 'honey-tongued Boyet.' 
Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET; ROSALINE, 
The virtue of your eye must break my oath. 
As the unsullied lily, I protest,

When the battle's lost and won. 
THIRD WITCH. That will be ere the set of sun. 
FIRST WITCH. Where the place? 
SECOND WITCH. Upon the heath. 
Hover through the fog and filthy air. Exeunt. 
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt 
The newest state. 
MALCOLM. This is the sergeant 
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil 
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald- 
The multiplying villainies of nature 
Do swarm upon him -from the Western Isles 
Till he faced the slave, 
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps, 
SERGEANT. As whence the sun 'gins his reflection 
But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, 
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion. 
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe. 
MALCOLM The worthy Thane of Ross. 
ROSS. God save the King! 
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky 
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict, 
The victory fell on us. 
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition; 
Enter the three Witches. 
"Aroint thee, witch!" the rump-fed ronyon cries. 
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master the Tiger; 
FIRST WITCH. I myself have all the other, 
And the very ports they blow, 
All the quarters that they know 
I' the shipman's card. 
ALL. The weird sisters, hand in hand, 
Posters of the sea and land, 
Peace! The charm's wound up. 
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth, 
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth, 
If you can look into the seeds of time, 
But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives, 
Stands not within the prospect of belief, 
BANQUO. The earth hath bubbles as the water has, 
MACBETH. Into the air, and what seem'd corporal melted 
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd! 
Or have we eaten on the insane root 
That takes the reason prisoner? 
BANQUO. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here? 
ROSS. The King hath happily received, Macbeth, 
The news of thy success; and when he reads 
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, 
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day, 
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks, 
BANQUO. What, can the devil speak true? 
MACBETH. The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me 
ANGUS. Who was the Thane lives yet, 
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel 
The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus] Thanks for your 
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me 
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown, 
Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange; 
The instruments of darkness tell us truths, 
As happy prologues to the swelling act 
Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen. 
Against the use of nature? Present fears 
But with the aid of use. 
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day. 
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King. 
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak 
Forres. The palace. 
Became him like the leaving it; he died 
To throw away the dearest thing he owed 
To find the mind's construction in the face: 
The sin of my ingratitude even now 
That the proportion both of thanks and payment

The harvest is your own. 
And you whose places are the nearest, know 
The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must 
MACBETH. The rest is labor, which is not used for you. 
I'll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful 
The hearing of my wife with your approach; 
MACBETH. [Aside.] The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step 
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be 
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see. Exit. 
LADY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have 
learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than 
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the 
before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the 
that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being 
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness 
To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great; 
The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly, 
And chastise with the valor of my tongue 
All that impedes thee from the golden round, 
MESSENGER. The King comes here tonight. 
One of my fellows had the speed of him, 
The raven himself is hoarse 
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan 
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full 
Stop up the access and passage to remorse, 
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts, 
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell 
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes 
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark 
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter! 
The future in the instant. 
May read strange matters. To beguile the time, 
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye, 
Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower, 
But be the serpent under it. He that's coming 
Leave all the rest to me. Exeunt. 
DUNCAN. This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air 
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve 
By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath 
The air is delicate. 
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, 
And the late dignities heap'd up to them, 
DUNCAN. Where's the Thane of Cawdor? 
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose 
the stage. Then enter Macbeth. 
It were done quickly. If the assassination 
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch, 
Might be the be-all and the end-all -here, 
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases 
To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice 
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice 
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host, 
Who should against his murtherer shut the door, 
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan 
The deep damnation of his taking-off, 
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubin horsed 
Upon the sightless couriers of the air, 
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye, 
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur 
To prick the sides of my intent, but only 
And falls on the other. 
LADY MACBETH. He has almost supp'd. Why have you left the chamber? 
LADY MACBETH. Was the hope drunk 
To be the same in thine own act and valor 
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life 
Like the poor cat i' the adage? 
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place 
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me- 
And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you 
But screw your courage to the sticking-place 
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey 
That memory, the warder of the brain, 
Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason 
The unguarded Duncan? What not put upon 
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt 
Away, and mock the time with fairest show: 
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

FLEANCE. The moon is down; I have not heard the clock. 
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature 
BANQUO. What, sir, not yet at rest? The King's abed. 
By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up 
Our will became the servant to defect, 
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: 
If you would grant the time. 
MACBETH. Good repose the while. 
BANQUO. Thanks, sir, the like to you. 
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed. Exit Servant. 
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee. 
A dagger of the mind, a false creation, 
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain? 
Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going, 
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses, 
Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, 
It is the bloody business which informs 
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one half-world 
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates 
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf, 
And take the present horror from the time, 
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. 
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me. 
The same. 
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, 
Which gives the stern'st good night. He is about it: 
The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms 
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed 
MACBETH. I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise? 
LADY MACBETH. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. 
Who lies i' the second chamber? 
MACBETH. One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other, 
Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep, 
Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care, 
The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, 
MACBETH. Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house; 
Why did you bring these daggers from the place? 
The sleepy grooms with blood. 
Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead 
Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood 
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal, 
The multitudinous seas incarnadine, 
Making the green one red. 
At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber. 
The same.

Knock, knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of Belzebub? Here's 
a farmer that hanged himself on th' expectation of plenty. Come

bonfire. [Knocking within.] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the

it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes 
away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an

MACDUFF. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night. 
PORTER. That it did, sir, i' the very throat on me; but requited 
MACDUFF. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane? 
I have almost slipp'd the hour. 
MACBETH. The labor we delight in physics pain. 
This is the door. 
LENNOX. Goes the King hence today? 
LENNOX. The night has been unruly. Where we lay, 
Lamentings heard i' the air, strange screams of death, 
New hatch'd to the woeful time. The obscure bird 
Clamor'd the livelong night. Some say the earth 
MACBETH. LENNOX. What's the matter? 
The Lord's anointed temple and stole thence 
The life o' the building. 
MACBETH. What is't you say? the life? 
MACDUFF. Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight 
Ring the alarum bell. Murther and treason! 
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo! 
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell. Bell rings. 
LADY MACBETH. What's the business, 
The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak! 
The repetition in a woman's ear 
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees 
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood 
Is stopped, the very source of it is stopp'd. 
The expedition of my violent love 
Outrun the pauser reason. Here lay Duncan, 
For ruin's wasteful entrance; there, the murtherers, 
Steep'd in the colors of their trade, their daggers 
MACDUFF. Look to the lady. 
Upon the foot of motion. 
BANQUO. Look to the lady. 
In the great hand of God I stand, and thence 
Against the undivulged pretense I fight 
And meet i' the hall together. 
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England. 
Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are 
There's daggers in men's smiles; the near in blood, 
The nearer bloody. 
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse; 
Within the volume of which time I have seen 
Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act, 
Threaten his bloody stage. By the clock 'tis day, 
And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp. 
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame, 
That darkness does the face of earth entomb, 
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last 
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, 
ROSS. They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes 
Here comes the good Macduff. 
How goes the world, sir, now? 
ROSS. Alas, the day!

As the weird women promised, and I fear 
But that myself should be the root and father 
Why, by the verities on thee made good, 
Command upon me, to the which my duties

'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better, 
I must become a borrower of the night 
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself 
ATTENDANT. They are, my lord, without the palace gate. 
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters 
When first they put the name of King upon me 
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand, 
For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd, 
Put rancors in the vessel of my peace 
Given to the common enemy of man, 
To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings! 
Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list, 
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there? 
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call. 
That it was he in the times past which held you 
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd, the instruments, 
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave 
MACBETH. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men, 
All by the name of dogs. The valued file 
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, 
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one 
According to the gift which bounteous nature 
Particular addition, from the bill 
Now if you have a station in the file, 
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say it, 
Grapples you to the heart and love of us, 
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world 
I do to spite the world. 
Who I myself struck down. And thence it is 
Masking the business from the common eye 
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time, 
The moment on't; fort must be done tonight 
And something from the palace (always thought 
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work- 
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate 
The palace. 
LADY MACBETH. Say to the King I would attend his leisure 
MACBETH. We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it. 
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, 
In the affliction of these terrible dreams 
That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead, 
Than on the torture of the mind to lie 
Unsafe the while, that we 
Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown 
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums 
MACBETH. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, 
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, 
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, 
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow 
Makes wing to the rooky wood; 
A park near the palace. 
To the direction just. 
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day; 
Now spurs the lated traveler apace 
To gain the timely inn, and near approaches 
The subject of our watch. 
SECOND MURTHERER. Then 'tis he; the rest 
That are within the note of expectation 
Already are i' the court. 
So all men do -from hence to the palace gate 
THIRD MURTHERER. Who did strike out the light? 
FIRST MURTHERER. Wast not the way? 
THIRD MURTHERER. There's but one down; the son is fled. 
A Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared. 
And last the hearty welcome. 
And play the humble host. 
Enter first Murtherer to the door. 
Both sides are even; here I'll sit i' the midst. 
The table round. [Approaches the door.] There's blood upon thy 
MACBETH. Thou art the best o' the cut-throats! Yet he's good 
That did the like for Fleance. If thou didst it, 
Thou art the nonpareil. 
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, 
As broad and general as the casing air; 
The least a death to nature. 
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled 
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow 
You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold 
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; 
The Ghost of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeth's place. 
Were the graced person of our Banquo present, 
MACBETH. The table's full. 
The fit is momentary; upon a thought 
Which might appal the devil. 
This is the very painting of your fear; 
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said 
Shall be the maws of kites. Exit Ghost. 
MACBETH. Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time, 
Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal; 
Too terrible for the ear. The time has been, 
That, when the brains were out, the man would die, 
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table, 
LORDS. Our duties and the pledge. 
MACBETH. Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee! 
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time. 
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear, 
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger; 
And dare me to the desert with thy sword. 
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow! 
LADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, 
Even to the disposition that I owe 
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks 
Stand not upon the order of your going, 
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night? 
MACBETH. I hear it by the way, but I will send. 
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters. 
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good 
LADY MACBETH. You lack the season of all natures, sleep. 
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use. 
Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecate. 
And I, the mistress of your charms, 
The close contriver of all harms, 
Or show the glory of our art? 
And at the pit of Acheron 
Meet me i' the morning. Thither he 
I am for the air; this night I'll spend 
Upon the corner of the moon 
As by the strength of their illusion 
Forres. The palace. 
Thing's have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan 
And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late, 
Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous 
In pious rage, the two delinquents tear 
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? 
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say, 
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear, 
LORD. The son of Duncan, 
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, 
Lives in the English court and is received 
Of the most pious Edward with such grace 
That the malevolence of fortune nothing 
Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid 
That by the help of these, with Him above 
To ratify the work, we may again

A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron. Thunder. 
Enter the three Witches. 
FIRST WITCH. Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd. 
SECOND WITCH. Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined. 
FIRST WITCH. Round about the cauldron go; 
In the poison'd entrails throw. 
Boil thou first i' the charmed pot. 
In the cauldron boil and bake; 
Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark, 
Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark, 
Sliver'd in the moon's eclipse, 
Make the gruel thick and slab. 
For the ingredients of our cawdron. 
Then the charm is firm and good. 
Enter Hecate to the other three Witches. 
And everyone shall share i' the gains. 
And now about the cauldron sing, 
SECOND WITCH. By the pricking of my thumbs, 
Though you untie the winds and let them fight 
Against the churches, though the yesty waves 
Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure 
From the murtherer's gibbet throw 
Into the flame. 
Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough. 
More potent than the first. 
The power of man, for none of woman born 
That rises like the issue of a king, 
And wears upon his baby brow the round 
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree 
Rebellion's head, rise never till the Wood 
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath 
A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; 
MACBETH. Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo Down! 
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first. 
A third is like the former. Filthy hags! 
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom? 
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass 
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me, 
And show the best of our delights. 
I'll charm the air to give a sound, 
Music. The Witches dance and 
Stand ay accursed in the calendar! 
MACBETH. Saw you the weird sisters? 
MACBETH. Infected be the 'air whereon they ride, 
The galloping of horse. Who wast came by? 
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook 
Unless the deed go with it. From this moment 
The very firstlings of my heart shall be 
The firstlings of my hand. And even now, 
The castle of Macduff I will surprise, 
Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o' the sword 
LADY MACDUFF. What had he done, to make him fly the land? 
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren, 
The most diminutive of birds, will fight, 
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl. 
All is the fear and nothing is the love; 
As little is the wisdom, where the flight 
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak much further; 
But cruel are the times when we are traitors 
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward 
LADY MACDUFF. Poor bird! Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime, 
The pitfall nor the gin. 
LADY MACDUFF. Why, the honest men. 
SON. Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars and 
swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them. 
England. Before the King's palace. 
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men 
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds 
As I shall find the time to friend, I will. 
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell. 
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace, 
The title is affeer'd. Fare thee well, lord. 
I would not be the villain that thou think'st 
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp 
And the rich East to boot. 
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke; 
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head, 
All the particulars of vice so grafted 
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state 
MACDUFF. Not in the legions 
The cestern of my lust, and my desire 
The untimely emptying of the happy throne, 
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink. 
I should cut off the nobles for their lands, 
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal, 
The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear; 
MALCOLM. But I have none. The king-becoming graces, 
In the division of each several crime, 
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell, 
Uproar the universal peace, confound 
Since that the truest issue of thy throne 
Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee, 
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts 
The taints and blames I laid upon myself, 
The devil to his fellow, and delight 
Now we'll together, and the chance of goodness 
MALCOLM. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth, I pray you? 
The great assay of art, but at his touch, 
MACDUFF. What's the disease he means? 
MALCOLM. 'Tis call'd the evil: 
All swol'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, 
The mere despair of surgery, he cures, 
To the succeeding royalty he leaves 
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue 
The means that makes us strangers! 
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air, 
A modern ecstasy. The dead man's knell 
Expire before the flowers in their caps, 
MALCOLM. What's the newest grief? 
ROSS. That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker; 
MACDUFF. The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace? 
ROSS. When I came hither to transport the tidings, 
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather, 
For that I saw the tyrant's power afoot. 
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland 
This comfort with the like! But I have words 
That would be howl'd out in the desert air, 
The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief 
But in it shares some woe, though the main part 
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound 
Savagely slaughter'd. To relate the manner 
Were, on the quarry of these murther'd deer, 
To add the death of you. 
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak 
Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break. 
MACDUFF. And I must be from thence! 
MALCOLM. Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief 
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it. 
MACDUFF. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes 
Come, go we to the King; our power is ready, 
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above

The country near Dunsinane. Drum and colors.

His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.

Excite the mortified man. 
Of all the gentry. There is Seward's son 
MENTEITH. What does the tyrant? 
Within the belt of rule. 
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, 
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds. 
Dunsinane. A room in the castle. 
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm? 
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know 
And mingle with the English epicures! 
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear 
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon! 
SERVANT. The English force, so please you. 
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf, 
Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not. 
Send out more horses, skirr the country round, 
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow, 
Raze out the written troubles of the brain, 
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff 
Which weighs upon the heart?

Dunsinane. Within the castle. 
MACBETH. Hang out our banners on the outward walls; 
The cry is still, "They come!" Our castle's strength 
Till famine and the ague eat them up. 
SEYTON. It is the cry of women, my good lord. Exit. 
MACBETH. I have almost forgot the taste of fears: 
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd 
SEYTON. The Queen, my lord, is dead. 
To the last syllable of recorded time; 
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage

The Wood began to move. 
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive, 
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend

And wish the estate o' the world were now undone. 
Ring the alarum bell! Blow, wind! Come, wrack! 
Dunsinane. Before the castle. 
Do we but find the tyrant's power tonight, 
Dunsinane. Before the castle. Alarums. 
But bear-like I must fight the course. What's he 
YOUNG SIWARD. The devil himself could not pronounce a title 
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st. 
MACDUFF. That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face! 
SIWARD. This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd. 
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight, 
The noble Thanes do bravely in the war, 
The day almost itself professes yours, 
SIWARD. Enter, sir, the castle. 
Another part of the field. 
MACBETH. Why should I play the Roman fool and die 
On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes 
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air 
And let the angel whom thou still hast served 
That keep the word of promise to our ear 
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time. 
"Here may you see the tyrant." 
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet, 
And to be baited with the rabble's curse. 
Yet I will try the last. Before my body 
the other Thanes, and Soldiers. 
MALCOLM. I would the friends we miss were safe arrived. 
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd 
In the unshrinking station where he fought,

ROSS. Ay, on the front. 
The usurper's cursed head. The time is free.

How now! what's the news with you?

As that the sin hath brought you to this shame, 
And take the shame with joy. 
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil 
Of my conception. The state whereon I studied 
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,

The phrase is to the matter. 
DUKE. Mended again. The matter- proceed. 
ISABELLA. In brief- to set the needless process by, 
For this was of much length- the vile conclusion 
And I did yield to him. But the next morn betimes, 
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice 
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up 
I do not like the man; had he been lay, my lord, 
I saw them at the prison; a saucy friar, 
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools! 
Is this the witness, friar? 
DUKE. For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too! 
With all th' effect of love. 
Which once thou swor'st was worth the looking on; 
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract, 
Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body 
That took away the match from Isabel,

Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox, 
Good night to your redress! Is the Duke gone? 
Then is your cause gone too. The Duke's unjust 
And put your trial in the villain's mouth 
LUCIO. This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. 
And in the witness of his proper ear, 
To th' Duke himself, to tax him with injustice? 
Take him hence; to th' rack with him! We'll touze you 
DUKE. Be not so hot; the Duke 
Till it o'errun the stew: laws for all faults, 
But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes 
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, 
ESCALUS. Slander to th' state! Away with him to prison! 
Is this the man that you did tell us of? 
DUKE. I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice. I met you at 
the prison, in the absence of the Duke. 
LUCIO. O did you so? And do you remember what you said of the Duke? 
LUCIO. Do you so, sir? And was the Duke a fleshmonger, a fool, and

It was the swift celerity of his death, 
The very mercy of the law cries out 
We do condemn thee to the very block 
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour, 
And, for the most, become much more the better 
In that he did the thing for which he died; 
That perish'd by the way. Thoughts are no subjects;

For testimony whereof, one in the prison, 
Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood

Which make such wanton gambols with the wind 
To be the dowry of a second head- 
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre. 
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore 
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf 
The seeming truth which cunning times put on 
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold, 
And here choose I. Joy be the consequence! 
PORTIA. [Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air, 
BASSANIO. [Opening the leaden casket] What find I here? 
Or whether riding on the balls of mine 
The painter plays the spider, and hath woven 
A golden mesh t' entrap the hearts of men 
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow 
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll, 
The continent and summary of my fortune. 
'You that choose not by the view, 
Exceed account. But the full sum of me 
Is now converted. But now I was the lord 
Let it presage the ruin of your love, 
Among the buzzing pleased multitude, 
I wish you all the joy that you can wish, 
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you 
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid; 
Your fortune stood upon the caskets there, 
And so did mine too, as the matter falls; 
GRATIANO. We'll play with them: the first boy for a thousand 
If that the youth of my new int'rest here 
But meeting with Salerio by the way, 
Will show you his estate. [BASSANIO opens the letter] 
Your hand, Salerio. What's the news from Venice? 
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece. 
SALERIO. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost. 
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek: 
Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world 
Could turn so much the constitution 
And I must freely have the half of anything 
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words 
I freely told you all the wealth I had 
The paper as the body of my friend, 
And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch 
The present money to discharge the Jew, 
A creature that did bear the shape of man 
He plies the Duke at morning and at night, 
And doth impeach the freedom of the state, 
The Duke himself, and the magnificoes 
But none can drive him from the envious plea 
Than twenty times the value of the sum 
BASSANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man, 
The best condition'd and unwearied spirit 
The ancient Roman honour more appears 
PORTIA. What sum owes he the Jew? 
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond; 
To pay the petty debt twenty times over. 
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

This is the fool that lent out money gratis. 
The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder, 
To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield,

SOLANIO. I am sure the Duke 
ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law; 
For the commodity that strangers have 
Will much impeach the justice of the state, 
Since that the trade and profit of the city 
In bearing thus the absence of your lord. 
I know you would be prouder of the work 
That do converse and waste the time together, 
Being the bosom lover of my lord, 
How little is the cost I have bestowed 
In purchasing the semblance of my soul 
From out the state of hellish cruelty! 
This comes too near the praising of myself; 
The husbandry and manage of my house 
The which my love and some necessity 
And use thou all th' endeavour of a man 
Unto the traject, to the common ferry 
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two, 
And wear my dagger with the braver grace, 
And speak between the change of man and boy 
At the park gate; and therefore haste away,

be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you.

that you are not the Jew's daughter. 
JESSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my

making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow all 
to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the 
of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you 
raise the price of pork. 
LORENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you 
can the getting up of the negro's belly; the Moor is with child 
LAUNCELOT. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but 
LORENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best

LORENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the

The fool hath planted in his memory 
Defy the matter. How cheer'st thou, Jessica? 
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife? 
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life, 
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth; 
And on the wager lay two earthly women, 
Pawn'd with the other; for the poor rude world 
Venice. The court of justice 
Enter the DUKE, the MAGNIFICOES, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, 
The very tyranny and rage of his. 
DUKE OF VENICE. Go one, and call the Jew into the court. 
SALERIO. He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord. 
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too, 
To the last hour of act; and then, 'tis thought, 
And where thou now exacts the penalty, 
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture, 
Forgive a moiety of the principal, 
To have the due and forfeit of my bond. 
If you deny it, let the danger light 
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' th' nose, 
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood 
To excuse the current of thy cruelty. 
BASSANIO. Do all men kill the things they do not love? 
SHYLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kill? 
ANTONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew. 
You may as well go stand upon the beach 
And bid the main flood bate his usual height; 
You may as well use question with the wolf, 
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb; 
You may as well forbid the mountain pines 
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven; 
Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will. 
'The slaves are ours.' So do I answer you: 
The pound of flesh which I demand of him 
There is no force in the decrees of Venice. 
A messenger with letters from the doctor, 
DUKE OF VENICE. Bring us the letters; call the messenger. 
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all, 
ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock, 
Meetest for death; the weakest kind of fruit 
Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me. 
SHYLOCK. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there. 
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness 
Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit 
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet, 
SHYLOCK. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond, 
Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter. 
CLERK. [Reads] 'Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt 
of your letter I am very sick; but in the instant that your

DUKE OF VENICE. YOU hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes; 
And here, I take it, is the doctor come. 
Are you acquainted with the difference 
That holds this present question in the court? 
PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause. 
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew? 
PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow; 
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law 
PORTIA. Do you confess the bond? 
PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful. 
PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain'd; 
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven 
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: 
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes 
The throned monarch better than his crown; 
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, 
The attribute to awe and majesty, 
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; 
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 
That in the course of justice none of us 
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much 
To mitigate the justice of thy plea, 
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. 
SHYLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law, 
The penalty and forfeit of my bond. 
BASSANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court; 
Yea, twice the sum; if that will not suffice, 
Wrest once the law to your authority; 
And many an error, by the same example, 
Will rush into the state; it cannot be. 
PORTIA. I pray you, let me look upon the bond. 
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim 
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful. 
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond. 
SHYLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour. 
You know the law; your exposition 
Hath been most sound; I charge you by the law, 
There is no power in the tongue of man 
ANTONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court 
To give the judgment. 
PORTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law 
Hath full relation to the penalty, 
Which here appeareth due upon the bond. 
So says the bond; doth it not, noble judge? 
'Nearest his heart,' those are the very words. 
The flesh? 
SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond? 
SHYLOCK. I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond. 
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, 
Tell her the process of Antonio's end; 
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge 
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, 
But life itself, my wife, and all the world, 
If she were by to hear you make the offer. 
The wish would make else an unquiet house. 
SHYLOCK. [Aside] These be the Christian husbands! I have a 
Would any of the stock of Barrabas 
The court awards it and the law doth give it. 
The law allows it and the court awards it. 
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh.' 
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed 
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate 
Unto the state of Venice. 
SHYLOCK. Is that the law? 
PORTIA. Thyself shalt see the act; 
SHYLOCK. I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice, 
And let the Christian go. 
BASSANIO. Here is the money. 
The Jew shall have all justice. Soft! No haste. 
He shall have nothing but the penalty. 
PORTIA. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh. 
As makes it light or heavy in the substance, 
Or the division of the twentieth part 
Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn 
But in the estimation of a hair- 
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip. 
PORTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture. 
PORTIA. He hath refus'd it in the open court; 
PORTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture 
SHYLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it! 
The law hath yet another hold on you. 
It is enacted in the laws of Venice, 
He seek the life of any citizen, 
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive 
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half 
Comes to the privy coffer of the state; 
And the offender's life lies in the mercy 
Of the Duke only, 'gainst all other voice. 
Thou hast contrived against the very life 
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd 
The danger formerly by me rehears'd. 
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke. 
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state, 
Thou hast not left the value of a cord; 
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge. 
DUKE OF VENICE. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, 
The other half comes to the general state, 
PORTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio. 
You take my house when you do take the prop 
When you do take the means whereby I live. 
ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court 
To quit the fine for one half of his goods; 
The other half in use, to render it 
Upon his death unto the gentleman 
The other, that he do record a gift, 
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd 
The pardon that I late pronounced here. 
I am not well; send the deed after me 
To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font. 
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew, 
BASSANIO.. There's more depends on this than on the value. 
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, 
ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring. 
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst, 
And in the morning early will we both 
PORTIA. Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed, 
That they did give the rings away to men; 
Belmont. The garden before PORTIA'S house 
LORENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this, 
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees, 
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls, 
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents, 
Did Thisby fearfully o'ertrip the dew, 
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself, 
Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love 
Medea gathered the enchanted herbs 
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew, 
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man. 
LORENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night? 
My mistress will before the break of day 
Some welcome for the mistress of the house. 
Within the house, your mistress is at hand; 
And bring your music forth into the air. Exit STEPHANO 
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank! 
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music 
Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night 
Become the touches of sweet harmony. 
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven 
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st 
Still quiring to the young-ey'd cherubins; 
LORENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive; 
Which is the hot condition of their blood- 
By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet 
But music for the time doth change his nature. 
The man that hath no music in himself, 
The motions of his spirit are dull:as night, 
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music. 
NERISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle. 
PORTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less: 
Into the main of waters. Music! hark! 
NERISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house. 
PORTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark 
No better a musician than the wren. 
Peace, ho! The moon sleeps with Endymion, 
LORENZO. That is the voice, 
PORTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo, 
By the bad voice. 
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words. 
PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick; 
Such as the day is when the sun is hid. 
BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes, 
If you would walk in absence of the sun. 
This is the man, this is Antonio, 
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk. 
PORTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What's the matter? 
For all the world like cutler's poetry 
NERISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value? 
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it. 
No higher than thyself, the judge's clerk; 
Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth 
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano, 
And swear I lost the ring defending it. 
Unto the judge that begg'd it, and indeed 
Deserv'd it too; and then the boy, his clerk, 
But the two rings. 
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone. 
Until I see the ring. 
If you did know to whom I gave the ring, 
If you did know for whom I gave the ring, 
And would conceive for what I gave the ring, 
And how unwillingly I left the ring, 
When nought would be accepted but the ring, 
You would abate the strength of your displeasure. 
PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring, 
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring, 
Or your own honour to contain the ring, 
You would not then have parted with the ring. 
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty 
To urge the thing held as a ceremony? 
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring. 
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him, 
Even he that had held up the very life 
For by these blessed candles of the night, 
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor. 
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved, 
For, if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen. 
ANTONIO. I am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels. 
And in the hearing of these many friends 
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord 
And bid him keep it better than the other. 
BASSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor! 
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me. 
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk, 
GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways 
In summer, where the ways are fair enough. 
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor, 
BASSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not? 
GRATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold? 
NERISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, 
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift, 
LORENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way 
GRATIANO. Let it be so. The first inter'gatory 
Whether till the next night she had rather stay, 
But were the day come, I should wish it dark, 
Till I were couching with the doctor's clerk.

And I serve the Fairy Queen, 
To dew her orbs upon the green.

PUCK. The King doth keep his revels here to-night; 
Take heed the Queen come not within his sight; 
And jealous Oberon would have the child 
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild; 
But she perforce withholds the loved boy, 
That frights the maidens of the villagery, 
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern, 
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn, 
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm, 
I am that merry wanderer of the night. 
And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.

And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,

TITANIA. These are the forgeries of jealousy; 
And never, since the middle summer's spring, 
Or in the beached margent of the sea, 
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind, 
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, 
As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea 
Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land, 
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain, 
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn 
The fold stands empty in the drowned field, 
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock; 
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud, 
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green, 
The human mortals want their winter here; 
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods, 
Pale in her anger, washes all the air, 
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts 
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose; 
Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer, 
The childing autumn, angry winter, change 
Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world, 
The fairy land buys not the child of me. 
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night, 
Marking th' embarked traders on the flood; 
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive, 
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind; 
Would imitate, and sail upon the land, 
That the rude sea grew civil at her song, 
To hear the sea-maid's music. 
Flying between the cold moon and the earth 
At a fair vestal, throned by the west, 
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon; 
And the imperial vot'ress passed on, 
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell. 
Fetch me that flow'r, the herb I showed thee once. 
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid 
Upon the next live creature that it sees. 
Ere the leviathan can swim a league. 
PUCK. I'll put a girdle round about the earth 
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes; 
The next thing then she waking looks upon, 
She shall pursue it with the soul of love. 
The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me. 
HELENA. And even for that do I love you the more. 
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you. 
DEMETRIUS. Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit; 
To leave the city and commit yourself 
Into the hands of one that loves you not; 
To trust the opportunity of night, 
And the ill counsel of a desert place, 
With the rich worth of your virginity. 
Therefore I think I am not in the night; 
For you, in my respect, are all the world. 
When all the world is here to look on me? 
DEMETRIUS. I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes, 
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts. 
HELENA. The wildest hath not such a heart as you. 
Run when you will; the story shall be chang'd: 
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase; 
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind 
Makes speed to catch the tiger- bootless speed, 
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood. 
HELENA. Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field, 
To die upon the hand I love so well. Exit HELENA 
Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer. 
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows, 
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows, 
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, 
And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin, 
And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes, 
But do it when the next thing he espies 
May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man 
By the Athenian garments he hath on. 
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow. 
Another part of the wood 
Then, for the third part of a minute, hence: 
Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds; 
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders 
The FAIRIES Sing 
Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA'S eyelids 
LYSANDER. Fair love, you faint with wand'ring in the wood; 
And tarry for the comfort of the day. 
LYSANDER. O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence! 
Love takes the meaning in love's conference. 
HERMIA. With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd! 
PUCK. Through the forest have I gone, 
Despised the Athenian maid; 
And here the maiden, sleeping sound, 
On the dank and dirty ground. 
All the power this charm doth owe: 
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace. 
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground! 
The tedious minutes I with her have spent. 
The will of man is by his reason sway'd, 
And reason says you are the worthier maid. 
And touching now the point of human skill, 
Reason becomes the marshal to my will, 
For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things 
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings, 
Or as the heresies that men do leave 
Of all be hated, but the most of me!

So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen? 
BOTTOM. Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet- 
Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier, 
The ousel cock, so black of hue, 
The throstle with his note so true, 
The wren with little quill. 
The finch, the sparrow, and the lark, 
The plain-song cuckoo grey, 
Who would give a bird the he, though he cry 'cuckoo' never so? 
On the first view, to say, to swear, I love thee. 
And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company 
together now-a-days. The more the pity that some honest 
The summer still doth tend upon my state; 
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep, 
The honey bags steal from the humble-bees, 
And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes, 
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies, 
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes. 
The moon, methinks, looks with a wat'ry eye; 
Another part of the wood 
The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort, 
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye, 
Rising and cawing at the gun's report, 
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky, 
But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes 
With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do? 
And the Athenian woman by his side; 
OBERON. Stand close; this is the same Athenian. 
PUCK. This is the woman, but not this the man. 
Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep, 
The sun was not so true unto the day 
This whole earth may be bor'd, and that the moon 
May through the centre creep and so displease 
Her brother's noontide with th' Antipodes. 
DEMETRIUS. So should the murdered look; and so should I, 
Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty; 
Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear, 
HERMIA. Out, dog! out, cur! Thou driv'st me past the bounds 
And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight. 
OBERON. About the wood go swifter than the wind, 
With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear. 
Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow. Exit 
As the Venus of the sky. 
And the youth mistook by me 
OBERON. Stand aside. The noise they make 
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true? 
Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow 
DEMETRIUS. Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, 
HERMIA. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, 
The ear more quick of apprehension makes; 
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense, 
It pays the hearing double recompense. 
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night 
The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so? 
Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd, 
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent, 
When we have chid the hasty-footed time 
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry, 
Though I alone do feel the injury. 
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up; 
Why then, you left me- O, the gods forbid!- 
HERMIA. 'Puppet!' why so? Ay, that way goes the game. 
Did not you tell me I should know the man 
By the Athenian garments he had on? 
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night; 
The starry welkin cover thou anon 
To take from thence all error with his might 
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend 
For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast; 
I with the Morning's love have oft made sport; 
And, like a forester, the groves may tread 
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red, 
To plainer ground. Exit LYSANDER as following the voice 
PUCK. Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars, 
Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars, 
The villain is much lighter heel'd than I. 
And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face. 
Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east, 
Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers, 
Here will I rest me till the break of day.

At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night, 
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor- 
That, from the sense of all civility, 
Let loose on me the justice of the state 
BRABANTIO. Strike on the tinder, ho! 
Against the Moor; for I do know, the state, 
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,

With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father! 
BRABANTIO. O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! 
By which the property of youth and maidhood

Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience 
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs. 
That, with the little godliness I have, 
That the magnifico is much beloved, 
As double as the Duke's. He will divorce you,

But that I love the gentle Desdemona, 
For the sea's worth. But, look! What lights come yond?

The goodness of the night upon you, friends! 
What is the news? 
CASSIO. The Duke does greet you, general, 
Even on the instant. 
OTHELLO. What is the matter, think you? 
It is a business of some heat. The galleys 
And many of the consuls, raised and met, 
Are at the Duke's already. You have been hotly call'd for, 
The Senate hath sent about three several quests 
I will but spend a word here in the house

For an abuser of the world, a practicer 
Both you of my inclining and the rest. 
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied, 
Upon some present business of the state 
The Duke's in council, and your noble self, 
BRABANTIO. How? The Duke in council? 
In this time of the night? Bring him away; 
Mine's not an idle cause. The Duke himself,

You shall yourself read in the bitter letter 
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,

The very head and front of my offending 
And little blest with the soft phrase of peace;

That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, 
Send for the lady to the Sagittary, 
The trust, the office I do hold of you, 
OTHELLO. Ancient, conduct them; you best know the place. 
I do confess the vices of my blood, 
Still question'd me the story of my life 
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, 
To the very moment that he bade me tell it: 
Of hair-breadth 'scapes i' the imminent deadly breach, 
Of being taken by the insolent foe 
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence 
It was my hint to speak- such was the process- 
And of the Cannibals that each other eat, 
The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads 
But still the house affairs would draw her thence, 
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd, 
This only is the witchcraft I have used. 
Here comes the lady; let her witness it. 
Take up this mangled matter at the best: 
If she confess that she was half the wooer, 
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress. 
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty, 
Due to the Moor, my lord. 
Please it your Grace, on to the state affairs; 
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended 
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. 
Is the next way to draw new mischief on. 
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; 
BRABANTIO. So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; 
He bears the sentence well, that nothing bears 
But the free comfort which from thence he hears; 
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow 
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear. 
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state. 
DUKE. The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus. 
Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you; and 
voice on you. You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss

Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war

May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdued 
Even to the very quality of my lord. 
A moth of peace, and he go to the war, 
The rites for which I love him are bereft me, 
To please the palate of my appetite, 
Nor to comply with heat- the young affects 
Either for her stay or going. The affair cries haste,

And bring them after in the best advantage.

To take the safest occasion by the front

And by him do my duties to the Senate. 
That done, I will be walking on the works; 
The garden of the castle. 
As if the cause were his. 
To the last article. My lord shall never rest; 
OTHELLO. The sooner, sweet, for you. 
I meet the captains at the citadel. 
I prithee, name the time, but let it not 
Save that, they say, the wars must make example 
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more; 
They're close dilations, working from the heart, 
The worst of words. 
Is the immediate jewel of their souls. 
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock 
The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss 
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend 
To follow still the changes of the moon 
When I shall turn the business of my soul 
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; 
And on the proof, there is no more but this- 
To show the love and duty that I bear you 
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks 
IAGO. Ay, there's the point, as- to be bold with you- 
Much will be seen in that. In the meantime, 
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind 
Into the vale of years- yet that's not much- 
And live upon the vapor of a dungeon, 
Than keep a corner in the thing I love 
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones: 
Prerogatived are they less than the base; 
Your dinner, and the generous islanders 
He puts the handkerchief from him, and she drops it. 
This was her first remembrance from the Moor. 
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token, 
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out, 
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, 
And, to the advantage, I being here took't up. 
Are to the jealous confirmations strong 
The Moor already changes with my poison: 
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste, 
But with a little act upon the blood 
Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so. 
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, 
OTHELLO. Avaunt! be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack. 
I slept the next night well, was free and merry; 
OTHELLO. I had been happy if the general camp, 
Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content! 
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars 
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump, 
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife, 
The royal banner, and all quality, 
The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit, 
Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof; 
Or, by the worth of man's eternal soul, 
OTHELLO. Make me to see't; or at the least so prove it, 
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop 
OTHELLO. By the world, 
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on? 
Which lead directly to the door of truth, 
IAGO. I do not like the office; 
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots, 
Cried, "Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!" 
It speaks against her with the other proofs. 
OTHELLO. O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! 
OTHELLO. Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea, 
To the Propontic and the Hellespont, 
In the due reverence of a sacred vow Kneels. 
The execution of his wit, hands, heart, 
And will upon the instant put thee to't: 
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,

The sun to course two hundred compasses, 
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;

I am most unhappy in the loss of it. 
And, lo, the happiness! Go and importune her.

DESDEMONA. Alas the day, I never gave him cause! 
They are not ever jealous for the cause, 
More tedious than the dial eight score times? 
To the felt absence now I feel a cause.

LODOVICO. He did not call; he's busy in the paper. 
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

If that the earth could teem with woman's tears, 
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate, 
LODOVICO. Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate 
Call all in all sufficient? This the nature 
The shot of accident nor dart of chance 
That stroke would prove the worst! 
Or did the letters work upon his blood,

OTHELLO. Nor send you out o' the way? 
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse! 
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives 
Leave procreants alone and shut the door; 
But not the words. 
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves

Am I the motive of these tears, my lord? 
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,

Or else dries up; to be discarded thence! 
OTHELLO. O, ay, as summer flies are in the shambles, 
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst ne'er been born! 
Heaven stops the nose at it, and the moon winks; 
The bawdy wind, that kisses all it meets, 
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth, 
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter, 
And keep the gate of hell! 
I pray you, turn the key, and keep our counsel. Exit.

The small'st opinion on my least misuse? 
IAGO. What's the matter, lady? 
IAGO. Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day! 
The Moor's abused by some most villainous knave, 
To lash the rascals naked through the world 
Even from the east to the west! 
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without, 
And made you to suspect me with the Moor. 
It doth abhor me now I speak the word; 
To do the act that might the addition earn 
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me. 
The business of the state does him offense,

That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor

To come in to the cry without more help.

I'll fetch the general's surgeon. [To Bianca.] For you, mistress,

Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?

Emilia, run you to the citadel, 
Will you go on? [Aside.] This is the night 
A bedchamber in the castle. Desdemona in bed asleep; a light burning. 
OTHELLO. It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul. 
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood, 
Put out the light, and then put out the light. 
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose, 
It must needs wither; I'll smell it on the tree. Kisses her. 
And love thee after. One more, and this the last; 
DESDEMONA. I will so. What's the matter? 
Send for the man, and ask him. 
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception 
I saw the handkerchief. 
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving? 
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good? 
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe 
Soft, by and by. Let me the curtains draw. 
Where art thou? Unlocks the door. 
What's the matter with thee now? 
OTHELLO. It is the very error of the moon; 
EMILIA. She said so; I must needs report the truth. 
EMILIA. O, the more angel she, 
And you the blacker devil! 
An honest man he is, and hates the slime 
I say thy husband. Dost understand the word? 
Rot half a grain a day! He lies to the heart. 
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murther, murther! 
MONTANO. What is the matter? How now, general? 
GRATIANO. What is the matter? 
EMILIA. And your reports have set the murther on. 
OTHELLO. O! O! O! Falls on the bed. 
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent 
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame 
No, I will speak as liberal as the north; 
GRATIANO. The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife. 
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor. 
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass, 
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan, 
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper- 
GRATIANO. What is the matter? 
Upon a soldier's thigh. I have seen the day 
From the possession of this heavenly sight! 
LODOVICO. Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth. 
Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave, 
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo, 
And here another. The one of them imports 
The death of Cassio to be undertook 
But that, belike, Iago in the interim 
OTHELLO. O the pernicious caitiff! 
Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came 
Till that the nature of your fault be known 
To the Venetian state. Come, bring away. 
I have done the state some service, and they know't. 
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand, 
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away 
Albeit unused to the melting mood, 
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees 
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, 
I took by the throat the circumcised dog 
Falls on the bed, and dies. 
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea! 
Look on the tragic loading of this bed; 
This is thy work. The object poisons sight; 
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house, 
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor, 
Remains the censure of this hellish villain, 
The time, the place, the torture. O, enforce it! 
Myself will straight aboard, and to the state

Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, 
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly. 
Once more, the more to aggravate the note, 
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war, 
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues, 
The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this. 
First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me 
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps, 
Disclaiming here the kindred of the King; 
By that and all the rites of knighthood else 
The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments 
Or here, or elsewhere to the furthest verge 
That all the treasons for these eighteen years 
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death, 
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth, 
And, by the glorious worth of my descent, 
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul. 
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest. 
The other part reserv'd I by consent, 
The honourable father to my foe, 
But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament 
This is my fault. As for the rest appeal'd, 
It issues from the rancour of a villain, 
Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom. 
We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son. 
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage. 
The one my duty owes; but my fair name, 
Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear, 
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood 
The purest treasure mortal times afford 
The slavish motive of recanting fear, 
The swelling difference of your settled hate; 
Justice design the victor's chivalry. 
London. The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace 
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER 
GAUNT. Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood 
To stir against the butchers of his life! 
Which made the fault that we cannot correct, 
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven; 
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth, 
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut; 
Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt; 
Who was the model of thy father's life. 
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life, 
The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death. 
GAUNT. God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute, 
Hath caus'd his death; the which if wrongfully, 
GAUNT. To God, the widow's champion and defence. 
Or, if misfortune miss the first career, 
And throw the rider headlong in the lists, 
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight. 
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye. Exeunt 
The lists at Coventry 
Enter the LORD MARSHAL and the DUKE OF AUMERLE 
MARSHAL. The Duke of Norfolk, spightfully and bold, 
Stays but the summons of the appelant's trumpet. 
AUMERLE. Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay 
The trumpets sound, and the KING enters with his nobles, 
The cause of his arrival here in arms; 
To swear him in the justice of his cause. 
MARSHAL. In God's name and the King's, say who thou art, 
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me; 
And, by the grace of God and this mine arm, 
The trumpets sound. Enter BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford, 
Depose him in the justice of his cause. 
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists, 
Except the Marshal and such officers 
MARSHAL. The appellant in all duty greets your Highness, 
As confident as is the falcon's flight 
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet. 
O thou, the earthly author of my blood, 
And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt, 
Even in the lusty haviour of his son. 
Be swift like lightning in the execution, 
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque 
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years. 
Order the trial, Marshal, and begin. 
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right! 
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, 
And dares him to set forward to the fight. 
Attending but the signal to begin. 
Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down. 
Withdraw with us; and let the trumpets sound 
A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council 
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect 
And for we think the eagle-winged pride 
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep; 
But tread the stranger paths of banishment. 
The sly slow hours shall not determinate 
The dateless limit of thy dear exile; 
The hopeless word of 'never to return' 
As to be cast forth in the common air, 
The language I have learnt these forty years, 
That knows no touch to tune the harmony. 
Swear by the duty that you owe to God, 
To keep the oath that we administer: 
By this time, had the King permitted us, 
One of our souls had wand'red in the air, 
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm; 
The clogging burden of a guilty soul. 
My name be blotted from the book of life, 
And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue. 
Save back to England, an the world's my way. Exit 
KING RICHARD. Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes 
Hath from the number of his banish'd years 
End in a word: such is the breath of Kings. 
For ere the six years that he hath to spend 
And in the sentence my own life destroy'd. 
When the tongue's office should be prodigal 
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart. 
GAUNT. The sullen passage of thy weary steps 
The precious jewel of thy home return. 
I wander from the jewels that I love. 
To foreign passages; and in the end, 
GAUNT. All places that the eye of heaven visits 
Think not the King did banish thee, 
But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit 
And not the King exil'd thee; or suppose 
Suppose the singing birds musicians, 
The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd, 
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more 
The man that mocks at it and sets it light. 
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus? 
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite 
O, no! the apprehension of the good 
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse. 
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore. 
London. The court 
Enter the KING, with BAGOT and GREEN, at one door; 
and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another 
But to the next high way, and there I left him. 
AUMERLE. Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind, 
Awak'd the sleeping rheum, and so by chance 
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft 
Marry, would the word 'farewell' have length'ned hours 
Observ'd his courtship to the common people; 
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles 
And had the tribute of his supple knee, 
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland, 
The revenue whereof shall furnish us 
KING RICHARD. Now put it, God, in the physician's mind 
The lining of his coffers shall make coats 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT, sick, with the DUKE OF YORK, etc. 
GAUNT. Will the King come, that I may breathe my last 
GAUNT. O, but they say the tongues of dying men 
The setting sun, and music at the close, 
As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last, 
As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond, 
The open ear of youth doth always listen; 
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity- 
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder; 
Against infection and the hand of war, 
This precious stone set in the silver sea, 
Which serves it in the office of a wall, 
Against the envy of less happier lands; 
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry 
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son; 
Dear for her reputation through the world, 
England, bound in with the triumphant sea, 
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege 
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life, 
YORK. The King is come; deal mildly with his youth, 
For young hot colts being rag'd do rage the more. 
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon 
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave, 
GAUNT. O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be. 
Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure 
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land. 
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world, 
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; 
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood 
That blood already, like the pelican, 
Join with the present sickness that I have; 
For both hast thou, and both become the grave. 
YORK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so! 
KING RICHARD. The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he; 
The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables, 
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke 
I am the last of noble Edward's sons, 
Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours; 
But when he frown'd, it was against the French 
But bloody with the enemies of his kin. 
KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the matter? 
The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford? 
Did not the one deserve to have an heir? 
Call in the letters patents that he hath 
YORK. I'll not be by the while. My liege, farewell. 
KING RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight; 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead. 
WILLOUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford? 
The King is not himself, but basely led 
That will the King severely prosecute 
ROSS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes; 
And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he find 
ROSS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm. 
WILLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man. 
But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke. 
Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm; 
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails, 
ROSS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer; 
And unavoided is the danger now 
For suffering so the causes of our wreck. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death 
How near the tidings of our comfort is. 
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter, 
All these, well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine, 
The first departing of the King for Ireland. 
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown, 
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt, 
You promis'd, when you parted with the King, 
QUEEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself 
More than with parting from my lord the King. 
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve; 
I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland. 
The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself, 
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy, 
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby, 
And all the rest revolted faction traitors? 
GREEN. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester 
And all the household servants fled with him 
QUEEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe, 
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life, 
GREEN. Here comes the Duke of York. 
Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth, 
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made; 
The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold 
But I shall grieve you to report the rest. 
SERVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duchess died. 
The King had cut off my head with my brother's. 
And bring away the armour that is there. 
Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd, 
BUSHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland. 
Proportionable to the enemy 
GREEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love 
Is near the hate of those love not the King. 
BAGOT. And that is the wavering commons; for their love 
BUSHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd. 
Because we ever have been near the King. 
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there. 
Will the hateful commons perform for us, 
GREEN. Alas, poor Duke! the task he undertakes 
Making the hard way sweet and delectable. 
The tediousness and process of my travel. 
But theirs is sweet'ned with the hope to have 
The present benefit which I possess; 
Than hope enjoy'd. By this the weary lords 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Queen? 
PERCY. No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court, 
The household of the King. 
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford; 
What power the Duke of York had levied there; 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy? 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke. 
PERCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, 
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour- 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby, 
BOLINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor; 
From the most gracious regent of this land, 
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on 
To take advantage of the absent time, 
Com'st thou because the anointed King is hence? 
Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind, 
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men, 
From forth the ranks of many thousand French, 
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise the 
YORK. Even in condition of the worst degree- 
Before the expiration of thy time, 
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath been too much abused. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is 
But for his own; and for the right of that 
YORK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms. 
Unto the sovereign mercy of the King; 
Unless you please to enter in the castle, 
The caterpillars of the commonwealth, 
And yet we hear no tidings from the King; 
The King reposeth all his confidence in thee. 
CAPTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay. 
The bay trees in our country are all wither'd, 
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; 
The pale-fac'd moon looks bloody on the earth, 
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy, 
The other to enjoy by rage and war. 
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings. 
SALISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind, 
Fall to the base earth from the firmament! 
The sun sets weeping in the lowly west, 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
From off my hands, here in the view of men 
Broke the possession of a royal bed, 
And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks 
Near to the King in blood, and near in love 
Eating the bitter bread of banishment, 
To show the world I am a gentleman. 
Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over 
To execution and the hand of death. 
BUSHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me 
And plague injustice with the pains of hell. 
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, and others, with the prisoners 
Uncle, you say the Queen is at your house; 
The coast of Wales. A castle in view 
Drums. Flourish and colours. Enter the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, 
AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air 
After your late tossing on the breaking seas? 
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet 
The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd 
The proffered means of succour and redress. 
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid, 
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world, 
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines 
The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs, 
Who all this while hath revell'd in the night, 
Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes, 
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east, 
Not able to endure the sight of day, 
Not all the water in the rough rude sea 
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king; 
The breath of worldly men cannot depose 
The deputy elected by the Lord. 
Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right. 
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead, 
KING RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men 
Is not the King's name twenty thousand names? 
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground, 
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold. 
The worst is death, and death will have his day. 
To bear the tidings of calamity. 
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores, 
As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears, 
So high above his limits swells the rage 
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot? 
That they have let the dangerous enemy 
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate. 
Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound 
And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground. 
AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead? 
AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power? 
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth. 
Save our deposed bodies to the ground? 
And that small model of the barren earth 
For God's sake let us sit upon the ground 
And tell sad stories of the death of kings: 
Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd, 
All murder'd-for within the hollow crown 
That rounds the mortal temples of a king 
Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits, 
Comes at the last, and with a little pin 
But presently prevent the ways to wail. 
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength, 
SCROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky 
The state in inclination of the day; 
I play the torturer, by small and small 
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken: 
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow, 
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue. 
The Welshmen are dispers'd; and Salisbury 
Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and good, my lord. 
YORK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland 
To say 'King Richard.' Alack the heavy day 
YORK. The time hath been, 
For taking so the head, your whole head's length. 
Lest you mistake. The heavens are over our heads. 
PIERCY. The castle royally is mann'd, my lord, 
Within the limits of yon lime and stone; 
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, 
NORTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle. 
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle; 
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley 
If not, I'll use the advantage of my power 
And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood 
Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen; 
The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke 
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land, 
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain. 
[NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a trumpet] 
Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum, 
With no less terror than the elements 
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven. 
Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water; 
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain 
My waters-on the earth, and not on him. 
Enter on the walls, the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, 
As doth the blushing discontented sun 
From out the fiery portal of the east, 
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent 
To dim his glory and to stain the track 
Of his bright passage to the occident. 
As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth 
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee, 
If we be not, show us the hand of God 
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre, 
And threat the glory of my precious crown. 
The purple testament of bleeding war; 
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace, 
Shall ill become the flower of England's face, 
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King 
And by the honourable tomb he swears 
And by the royalties of both your bloods, 
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt, 
And by the worth and honour of himself, 
KING RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns: 
And all the number of his fair demands 
With all the gracious utterance thou hast 
Defiance to the traitor, and so die? 
That laid the sentence of dread banishment 
KING RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit? 
The King shall do it. Must he be depos'd? 
The King shall be contented. Must he lose 
The name of king? A God's name, let it go. 
Or I'll be buried in the king's high way, 
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn 
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes 
Within the earth; and, therein laid-there lies 
NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, in the base court he doth attend 
Wanting the manage of unruly jades. 
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base, 
In the base court? Come down? Down, court! down, king! 
Enter the KING, and his attendants, below 
To make the base earth proud with kissing it. 
That know the strong'st and surest way to get. 
The DUKE OF YORK's garden 
Enter the QUEEN and two LADIES 
To drive away the heavy thought of care? 
QUEEN. 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs 
And that my fortune runs against the bias. 
It doth remember me the more of sorrow; 
But stay, here come the gardeners. 
Let's step into the shadow of these trees. 
Give some supportance to the bending twigs. 
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays 
The noisome weeds which without profit suck 
The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers. 
SERVANT. Why should we, in the compass of a pale, 
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land, 
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf; 
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter, 
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green. 
Hath seiz'd the wasteful King. O, what pity is it 
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees, 
Had he done so, himself had home the crown, 
SERVANT. What, think you the King shall be deposed? 
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's 
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested the 
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold 
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke, 
Besides himself, are all the English peers, 
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke? 
Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow! 
In the remembrance of a weeping queen. Exeunt 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
Enter, as to the Parliament, BOLINGBROKE, AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, PERCY, 
FITZWATER, SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, 
Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd 
The bloody office of his timeless end. 
BAGOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle. 
That reacheth from the restful English Court 
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns 
With the attainder of his slanderous lips. 
There is my gage, the manual seal of death 
To stain the temper of my knightly sword. 
AUMERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best 
To prove it on thee to the extremest point 
Over the glittering helmet of my foe! 
ANOTHER LORD. I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle; 
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest. 
The very time Aumerle and you did talk. 
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do he 
Engage it to the trial, if thou dar'st. 
Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say 
To execute the noble Duke at Calais. 
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross 
BOLINGBROKE. Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom 
YORK. Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to the 
To the possession of thy royal hand. 
BOLINGBROKE. In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne. 
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth. 
And shall the figure of God's majesty, 
The blood of English shall manure the ground, 
The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls. 
It will the woefullest division prove 
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit? 
bearing the regalia 
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts 
The favours of these men. Were they not mine? 
God save the King! Will no man say amen? 
God save the King! although I be not he; 
The resignation of thy state and crown 
KING RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown. 
The emptier ever dancing in the air, 
The other down, unseen, and full of water. 
The cares I give I have, though given away; 
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay. 
BOLINGBROKE. Are you contented to resign the crown? 
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart; 
Against the state and profit of this land; 
That, by confessing them, the souls of men 
Containing the deposing of a king 
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath, 
Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven. 
I find myself a traitor with the rest; 
T'undeck the pompous body of a king; 
No, not that name was given me at the font- 
But 'tis usurp'd. Alack the heavy day, 
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke 
NORTHUMBERLAND. Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. The Commons will not, then, be satisfied. 
When I do see the very book indeed 
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face 
Did keep ten thousand men? Was this the face 
That like the sun did make beholders wink? 
Is this the face which fac'd so many follies 
As brittle as the glory is the face; 
[Dashes the glass against the ground] 
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport- 
BOLINGBROKE. The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd 
The shadow of your face. 
The shadow of my sorrow? Ha! let's see. 
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief 
That swells with silence in the tortur'd soul. 
There lies the substance; and I thank thee, king, 
Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way 
How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon, 
BOLINGBROKE. Go, some of you convey him to the Tower. 
Exeunt all but the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, the 
CARLISLE. The woe's to come; the children yet unborn 
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot? 
You shall not only take the sacrament

London. A street leading to the Tower 
Enter the QUEEN, with her attendants 
QUEEN. This way the King will come; this is the way 
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand; 
From which awak'd, the truth of what we are 
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw 
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage 
Take the correction mildly, kiss the rod, 
Which art a lion and the king of beasts? 
In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire 
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me, 
And send the hearers weeping to their beds; 
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize 
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue, 
And in compassion weep the fire out; 
For the deposing of a rightful king. 
NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd; 
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower. 
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne, 
The time shall not be many hours of age 
Though he divide the realm and give thee half 
And he shall think that thou, which knowest the way 
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne. 
The love of wicked men converts to fear; 
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me; 
Part us, Northumberland; I towards the north, 
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime; 
QUEEN. Banish us both, and send the King with me. 
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near. 
QUEEN. So longest way shall have the longest moans. 
KING RICHARD. Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short, 
And piece the way out with a heavy heart. 
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say. Exeunt 
The DUKE OF YORK's palace 
Enter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUCHESS 
DUCHESS. My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest, 
When weeping made you break the story off, 
YORK. Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke, 
You would have thought the very windows spake, 
Upon his visage; and that all the walls 
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning, 
DUCHESS. Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst? 
YORK. As in a theatre the eyes of men 
After a well-grac'd actor leaves the stage 
The badges of his grief and patience, 
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted, 
And lasting fealty to the new-made king. 
DUCHESS. Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now 
That strew the green lap of the new come spring? 
Yea, look'st thou pale? Let me see the writing. 
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing. 
For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph-day. 
Boy, let me see the writing. 
DUCHESS. What is the matter, my lord? 
I will appeach the villain. 
DUCHESS. What is the matter? 
DUCHESS. I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle? 
YORK. Bring me my boots. I will unto the King. 
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own? 
A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament, 
To kill the King at Oxford. 
Spur post, and get before him to the King, 
And never will I rise up from the ground 
Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there, 
Takes on the point of honour to support 
PERCY. My lord, some two days since I saw the Prince, 
BOLINGBROKE. And what said the gallant? 
PERCY. His answer was, he would unto the stews, 
And from the common'st creature pluck a glove 
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger. 
AUMERLE. Where is the King? 
What is the matter with our cousin now? 
AUMERLE. For ever may my knees grow to the earth, 
If on the first, how heinous e'er it be, 
AUMERLE. Then give me leave that I may turn the key, 
[The DUKE OF YORK knocks at the door and crieth] 
YORK. [Within] Open the door, secure, foolhardy King. 
Open the door, or I will break it open. 
BOLINGBROKE. What is the matter, uncle? Speak; 
The treason that my haste forbids me show. 
I tore it from the traitor's bosom, King; 
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart. 
The traitor lives, the true man's put to death. 
Speak with me, pity me, open the door. 
And now chang'd to 'The Beggar and the King.' 
This fest'red joint cut off, the rest rest sound; 
This let alone will all the rest confound. 
And never see day that the happy sees 
Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow. 
'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech. 
The word is short, but not so short as sweet; 
That sets the word itself against the word! 
The chopping French we do not understand. 
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand. 
BOLINGBROKE. But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Abbot, 
With all the rest of that consorted crew, 
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels. 
EXTON. Didst thou not mark the King, what words he spake? 
As who should say 'I would thou wert the man 
Meaning the King at Pomfret. Come, let's go. 
I am the King's friend, and will rid his foe. Exeunt 
Pomfret Castle. The dungeon of the Castle 
This prison where I live unto the world 
And, for because the world is populous 
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul, 
My soul the father; and these two beget 
In humours like the people of this world, 
For no thought is contented. The better sort, 
With scruples, and do set the word itself 
Against the word, 
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.' 
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs 
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves, 
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars 
Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame, 
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back 
Of such as have before endur'd the like. 
With being nothing. [The music plays] 
So is it in the music of men's lives. 
And here have I the daintiness of ear 
But, for the concord of my state and time, 
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch, 
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is 
Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans, 
While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock. 
Enter a GROOM of the stable 
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear. 
GROOM. So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground. 
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck 
Who lately came from the King, commands the contrary. 
KING RICHARD. The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee! 
[Beats the KEEPER] 
The murderers, EXTON and servants, rush in, armed 
Hath with the King's blood stain'd the King's own land. 
Both have I spill'd. O, would the deed were good! 
For now the devil, that told me I did well, 
This dead King to the living King I'll bear. 
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here. Exeunt 
Flourish. Enter BOLINGBROKE, the DUKE OF YORK, With other LORDS 
BOLINGBROKE. Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear 
Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire 
Welcome, my lord. What is the news? 
The next news is, I have to London sent 
The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent. 
The manner of their taking may appear 
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely; 
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors 
Enter PERCY, With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE 
PERCY. The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster, 
Hath yielded up his body to the grave; 
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies, 
I hate the murderer, love him murdered. 
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour, 
I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,

GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent 
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house 
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. 
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, 
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute. 
Have no delight to pass away the time, 
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun 
And hate the idle pleasures of these days. 
To set my brother Clarence and the King 
In deadly hate the one against the other; 
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be. 
This conduct to convey me to th' Tower. 
That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower. 
But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know? 
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G, 
'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower; 
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower, 
But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds 
That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore. 
If we will keep in favour with the King, 
The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself, 
We speak no treason, man; we say the King 
And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks. 
Forbear your conference with the noble Duke. 
GLOUCESTER. We are the Queen's abjects and must obey. 
Brother, farewell; I will unto the King; 
GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return. 
If heaven will take the present at our hands. 
But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings? 
Well are you welcome to the open air. 
That were the cause of my imprisonment. 
HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew'd 
The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy, 
And leave the world for me to bustle in! 
The readiest way to make the wench amends 
The which will I-not all so much for love 
Enter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH, with halberds to guard it; 
LADY ANNE being the mourner, attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY 
Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster. 
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster! 
To hear the lamentations of poor Anne, 
Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds. 
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes. 
O, cursed be the hand that made these holes! 
Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it! 
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence! 
That makes us wretched by the death of thee 
May fright the hopeful mother at the view, 
More miserable by the death of him 
[The bearers take up the coffin] 
GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down. 
GLOUCESTER. Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul, 
FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the coffin 
[The bearers set down the coffin] 
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil. 
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell 
Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead; 
ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth! 
The which thou once didst bend against her breast, 
But that thy brothers beat aside the point. 
GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath 
ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest! 
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths 
As blameful as the executioner? 
ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect. 
GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect- 
To undertake the death of all the world 
As all the world is cheered by the sun, 
ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth. 
GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature. 
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made 
Told the sad story of my father's death, 
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks 
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale 
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, 
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke, 
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.

Take up the sword again, or take up me. 
Speak it again, and even with the word 
ANNE. To take is not to give. [Puts on the ring] 
GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse. 
The bleeding witness of my hatred by; 
But the plain devil and dissembling looks, 
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!

QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all 
GREY. The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son

But so it must be, if the King miscarry. 
GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Countess Richmond, good my Lord 
The envious slanders of her false accusers; 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of 
DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I 
Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers, 
I fear our happiness is at the height. 
Who is it that complains unto the King 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the 
The King, on his own royal disposition 
Makes him to send that he may learn the ground. 
GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad 
Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility 
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been 
GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean 
GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with telling of the 
I will avouch't in presence of the King. 
I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r. 
Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower, 
Were factious for the house of Lancaster; 
GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward's party for the crown; 
Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof! 
That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof. 
QUEEN MARGARET. As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof; 
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine. 
GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee, 
And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout 
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland- 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent. 
HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe, 
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of! 
Ready to catch each other by the throat, 
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven? 
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace! 
The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul! 
The slave of nature and the son of hell, 
O, let me make the period to my curse! 
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me 
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top, 
And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun. 
QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas! 
Witness my son, now in the shade of death, 
Nor thou within the compass of my curse. 
The lips of those that breathe them in the air. 
QUEEN MARGARET. I will not think but they ascend the sky 
His venom tooth will rankle to the death: 
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from? 
Live each of you the subjects to his hate, 
GLOUCESTER. Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong. 
God pardon them that are the cause thereof! 
GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl. 
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach 
I lay unto the grievous charge of others. 
And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies 
That stir the King against the Duke my brother. 
And seem a saint when most I play the devil. 
FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the 
[Gives the warrant] 
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution, 
London. The Tower 
So full of dismal terror was the time! 
CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower 
Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England, 
During the wars of York and Lancaster, 
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, 
Into the tumbling billows of the main. 
All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea; 
Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes 
That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep 
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by. 
KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death 
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep? 
To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood 
To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air; 
Who almost burst to belch it in the sea. 
O, then began the tempest to my soul! 
I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood 
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. 
The first that there did greet my stranger soul 
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury. 
Such hideous cries that, with the very noise, 
Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant 
Makes the night morning and the noontide night. 
There's nothing differs but the outward fame. 
Enter the two MURDERERS 
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands. 
Because I will be guiltless from the meaning. 
There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys. 
I'll to the King and signify to him 
SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great 
SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath 
be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can 
FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and 
FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's 
SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward. 
SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse! 
persuading me not to kill the Duke. 
SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe 
him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the 
FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of 
thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the 
FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks 
CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, 
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it. 
FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King. 
To slay the innocent? What is my offence? 
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me? 
Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd 
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death? 
The deed you undertake is damnable. 
CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings 
Hath in the tables of his law commanded 
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight 
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster. 
FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God 
Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son. 
If God will be avenged for the deed, 
Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm; 
CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage. 
From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven. 
To do this deed will hate you for the deed. 
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within. 
Exit with the body 
By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have 
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say; 
For I repent me that the Duke is slain. Exit 
Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole, 
Till that the Duke give order for his burial;

Lest He that is the supreme King of kings

BUCKINGHAM. [To the QUEEN] Whenever Buckingham 
To make the blessed period of this peace. 
Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke. 
KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day. 
More than the infant that is born to-night. 
Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead? 
BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest? 
DORSET. Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence 
KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd. 
Some tardy cripple bare the countermand 
DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life; 
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk. 
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake 
The mighty Warwick and did fight for me? 
Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury 
Who told me, when we both lay in the field 
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night? 
The precious image of our dear Redeemer, 
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all 
GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not 
How that the guilty kindred of the Queen 
O, they did urge it still unto the King! 
London. The palace 
Enter the old DUCHESS OF YORK, with the SON and DAUGHTER of CLARENCE 
I do lament the sickness of the King, 
The King mine uncle is to blame for it. 
DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you 
Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen, 
Why grow the branches when the root is gone? 
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap? 
That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's, 
And hast the comfort of thy children left; 
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon, 
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! 
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs! 
For it requires the royal debt it lent you. 
Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him; 
To wail the dimming of our shining star; 
That is the butt end of a mother's blessing; 
We are to reap the harvest of his son. 
The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts, 
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet 
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out, 
Which would be so much the more dangerous 
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd; 
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent, 
GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us; 
And the compact is firm and true in me. 
That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince. 
BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince, 
For by the way I'll sort occasion, 
As index to the story we late talk'd of, 
To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince. 
Enter one CITIZEN at one door, and another at the other 
Hear you the news abroad? 
FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead. 
SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the 
THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's 
SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while! 
FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth 
THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, 
With politic grave counsel; then the King 
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester! 
And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud; 
FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be 
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night? 
SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear. 
THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so; 
The water swell before a boist'rous storm. 
SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices. 
London. The palace 
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young DUKE OF YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH, 
and the DUCHESS OF YORK 
DUCHESS. I long with all my heart to see the Prince. 
DUCHESS. Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold 
In him that did object the same to thee. 
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young, 
ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince? 
MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham. 
MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd. 
Why or for what the nobles were committed 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house! 
The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind; 
Upon the innocent and aweless throne. 
I see, as in a map, the end of all. 
My husband lost his life to get the crown; 
Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors 
ARCHBISHOP. [To the QUEEN] My gracious lady, go. 
The seal I keep; and so betide to me 
Go, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary. Exeunt 
<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM 
The trumpets sound. Enter the PRINCE OF WALES, GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, 
The weary way hath made you melancholy. 
PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way 
GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your 
Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit; 
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart. 
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts. 
GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet 
Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train 
Would long ere this have met us on the way. 
BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating 
The Queen your mother and your brother York 
Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince 
Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York 
Can from his mother win the Duke of York, 
We should infringe the holy privilege 
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age, 
The benefit thereof is always granted 
To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place 
And those who have the wit to claim the place. 
Then, taking him from thence that is not there, 
PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may. 
Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower, 
PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place. 
Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age, 
Even to the general all-ending day. 
[Aside] Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity, 
Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL 
BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of 
The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far. 
YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it! 
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle 
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you. 
YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord? 
YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower. 
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower. 
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe. 
Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way. 
For the instalment of this noble Duke 
In the seat royal of this famous isle? 
CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince 
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower, 
To sit about the coronation. 
Be thou so too, and so break off the talk, 
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more. 
CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can. 
The earldom of Hereford and all the movables 
Whereof the King my brother was possess'd. 
Enter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS 
MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley. 
MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four. 
He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm. 
And that may be determin'd at the one 
Which may make you and him to rue at th' other. 
And with all speed post with him toward the north 
To shun the danger that his soul divines. 
Bid him not fear the separated council: 
His honour and myself are at the one, 
And at the other is my good friend Catesby; 
To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers. 
To fly the boar before the boar pursues 
Were to incense the boar to follow us 
And we will both together to the Tower, 
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly. 
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm. 
HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the 
Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd. 
Upon his party for the gain thereof; 
The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret. 
God knows I will not do it to the death. 
CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you- 
[Aside] For they account his head upon the bridge. 
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided? 
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood, 
STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from 
But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast. 
What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent. 
To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded. 
How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee? 
PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask. 
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower 
By the suggestion of the Queen's allies; 
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you. 
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest: 
The men you talk of came into my mind. 
What, go you toward the Tower? 
I shall return before your lordship thence. 
Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying the Nobles, 
GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you! 
RATCLIFF. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out. 
Within the guilty closure of thy walls 
RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death; 
RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate. 
London. The Tower 
Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP of ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, 
HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met 
Is to determine of the coronation. 
In God's name speak-when is the royal day? 
BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for the royal time? 
BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind 
Who is most inward with the noble Duke? 
But for his purpose in the coronation 
But you, my honourable lords, may name the time; 
And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice, 
BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself. 
I mean, your voice for crowning of the King. 
And finds the testy gentleman so hot 
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne. 
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd. 
Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY 
BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester? 
HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord, 
To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be. 
GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil. 
I will not dine until I see the same. 
The rest that love me, rise and follow me. 
STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms, 
And started when he look'd upon the Tower, 
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house. 
O, now I need the priest that spake to me! 
I now repent I told the pursuivant, 
RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at 
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God! 
Into the fatal bowels of the deep. 
I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee 
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head. 
London. The Tower-walls 
BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian; 
GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along. 
Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY 
GLOUCESTER. Look to the drawbridge there! 
GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlook the walls. 
BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent- 
LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor, 
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings. 
GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep. 
I took him for the plainest harmless creature 
That breath'd upon the earth a Christian; 
The history of all her secret thoughts. 
BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red 
We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor 
This day had plotted, in the council-house, 
Or that we would, against the form of law, 
Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death 
But that the extreme peril of the case, 
The peace of England and our persons' safety, 
To warn false traitors from the like attempts. 
Which now the loving haste of these our friends, 
The traitor speak, and timorously confess 
The manner and the purpose of his treasons: 
That you might well have signified the same 
Unto the citizens, who haply may 
T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world. 
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post. 
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time, 
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children. 
Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house, 
Which by the sign thereof was termed so. 
And, by true computation of the time, 
Found that the issue was not his begot; 
Being nothing like the noble Duke my father. 
BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator 
As if the golden fee for which I plead 
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords. Exit 
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight, 
Have any time recourse unto the Princes. Exit 
SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings; 
And mark how well the sequel hangs together: 
The precedent was full as long a-doing; 
Here's a good world the while! Who is so gros 
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought, 
GLOUCESTER. How now, how now! What say the citizens? 
BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord, 
The citizens are mum, say not a word. 
GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's 
Th' insatiate greediness of his desire, 
And his enforcement of the city wives; 
And his resemblance, being not like the Duke. 
Being the right idea of your father, 
And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence. 
His answer was, the people were not used 
To be spoke to but by the Recorder. 
'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'- 
At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps, 
And thus I took the vantage of those few- 
Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come? 
BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear; 
Play the maid's part: still answer nay, and take it. 
BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor 
Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens 
I think the Duke will not be spoke withal. 
BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke; 
Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen, 
Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof; 
Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence, 
To stay him from the fall of vanity; 
And pardon us the interruption 
Who, earnest in the service of my God, 
Deferr'd the visitation of my friends. 
That seems disgracious in the city's eye, 
The supreme seat, the throne majestical, 
The scept'red office of your ancestors, 
The lineal glory of your royal house, 
To the corruption of a blemish'd stock; 
Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts, 
The noble isle doth want her proper limbs; 
And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf 
Your gracious self to take on you the charge 
For this, consorted with the citizens, 
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, 
Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends. 
Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first, 
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last- 
And that my path were even to the crown, 
As the ripe revenue and due of birth, 
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd. 
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit 
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time, 
Will well become the seat of majesty 
The right and fortune of his happy stars, 
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, 
To Bona, sister to the King of France. 
Even in the afternoon of her best days, 
Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree 
This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince. 
If not to bless us and the land withal, 
From the corruption of abusing times 
Loath to depose the child, your brother's son; 
But we will plant some other in the throne 
To the disgrace and downfall of your house; 
If you deny them, all the land will rue it. 
Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest 
I must have patience to endure the load; 
Attend the sequel of your imposition, 
From all the impure blots and stains thereof; 
How far I am from the desire of this. 
GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth. 
GLOUCESTER. [To the BISHOPS] Come, let us to our holy

London. Before the Tower 
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester? 
Now, for my life, she's wand'ring to the Tower, 
On pure heart's love, to greet the tender Princes. 
ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess, 
Upon the like devotion as yourselves, 
To gratulate the gentle Princes there. 
And in good time, here the lieutenant comes. 
How doth the Prince, and my young son of York? 
The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. The King! Who's that? 
BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly 
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas, 
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell. 
Lest thou increase the number of the dead, 
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse, 
Take all the swift advantage of the hours; 
In your behalf, to meet you on the way. 
O my accursed womb, the bed of death! 
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world, 
O, would to God that the inclusive verge 
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains! 
And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen!' 
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands 
More miserable by the life of thee 
And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse, 
Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep, 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Stay, yet look back with me unto the 
London. The palace

KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch, 
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead. 
CATESBY. [Aside to another] The King is angry; see, he 
[Descends from the throne] 
KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, call him hither, 
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham 
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels. 
How now, Lord Stanley! What's the news? 
The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled 
To Richmond, in the parts where he abides. [Stands apart] 
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him. 
TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower. 
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them. 
The late request that you did sound me in. 
BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord. 
BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise, 
Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables 
KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth 
KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that 
BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom- 
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle 
BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten. 
KING RICHARD. Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the 
I am not in the giving vein to-day. 
KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.

TYRREL. The tyrannous and bloody act is done, 
The most arch deed of piteous massacre 
'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'- 
But, O, the devil'-there the villain stopp'd; 
The most replenished sweet work of nature 
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.' 
To bear this tidings to the bloody King. 
TYRREL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge 
TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them; 
But where, to say the truth, I do not know. 
When thou shalt tell the process of their death. 
KING RICHARD. The son of Clarence have I pent up close; 
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom, 
Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims 
And by that knot looks proudly on the crown, 
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen, 
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth. 
We must be brief when traitors brave the field. Exeunt 
London. Before the palace 
And drop into the rotten mouth of death. 
To watch the waning of mine enemies. 
And will to France, hoping the consequence 
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK 
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air 
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf? 
Give mine the benefit of seniory, 
And let my griefs frown on the upper hand. 
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept 
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth 
Preys on the issue of his mother's body 
The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward; 
Match'd not the high perfection of my loss. 
And the beholders of this frantic play, 
Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey, 
That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.' 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would 
The presentation of but what I was, 
The flattering index of a direful pageant, 
To be the aim of every dangerous shot, 
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene. 
Who sues, and kneels, and says 'God save the Queen'? 
Where be the bending peers that flattered thee? 
Where be the thronging troops that followed thee? 
For joyful mother, one that wails the name; 
Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about 
To torture thee the more, being what thou art. 
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow? 
And leave the burden of it all on thee. 
QUEEN MARGARET. Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the 
Bett'ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse; 
Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart. 
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother 
The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims. 
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done! 
The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown, 
And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers? 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, 
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women 
Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say! 
Or with the clamorous report of war 
That cannot brook the accent of reproof. 
DUCHESS. No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well 
Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell. 
Strike up the drum. 
Which in the day of battle tire thee more 
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st! 
My prayers on the adverse party fight; 
And there the little souls of Edward's children 
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. I have no moe sons of the royal blood 
Throw over her the veil of infamy; 
KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny. 
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt 
To revel in the entrails of my lambs. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. What good is cover'd with the face of 
KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of Fortune, 
The high imperial type of this earth's glory. 
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul 
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the process of thy 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her 
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body, 
KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way 
If I did take the kingdom from your sons, 
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb, 
Than is the doating title of a mother; 
The loss you have is but a son being King, 
The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife, 
And all the ruins of distressful times 
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed 
Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame 
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes 
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.

That God, the law, my honour, and her love

QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King's

QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third 
KING RICHARD. Now, by the world- 
The unity the King my husband made 
Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head, 
Had grac'd the tender temples of my child; 
And both the Princes had been breathing here, 
Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms. 
KING RICHARD. The time to come. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time 
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd, 
The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed, 
Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul, 
Be the attorney of my love to her; 
Urge the necessity and state of times, 
QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus? 
KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good. 
KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed. 
RATCLIFF. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast 
And there they hull, expecting but the aid 
KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of

Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke? 
The greatest strength and power that he can make

When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way? 
STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas. 
KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him! 
He makes for England here to claim the crown. 
KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd? 
Is the King dead, the empire unpossess'd? 
Then tell me what makes he upon the seas. 
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes. 
Are they not now upon the western shore, 
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships? 
STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.

The Britaine navy is dispers'd by tempest. 
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks 
CATESBY. My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken- 
That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond 
To Salisbury; the rest march on with me. 
That in the sty of the most deadly boar 
The fear of that holds off my present aid.

Enter the SHERIFF and guard, with BUCKINGHAM, led to execution 
Do through the clouds behold this present hour, 
This is the day which in King Edward's time 
This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall 
By the false faith of him whom most I trusted; 
Is the determin'd respite of my wrongs; 
Thus doth He force the swords of wicked men 
Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame; 
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame. Exeunt 
Bruis'd underneath the yoke of tyranny, 
Thus far into the bowels of the land

Is now even in the centre of this isle, 
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn. 
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace 
the EARL of SURREYS and others 
[Soldiers begin to set up the KING'S tent] 
Who hath descried the number of the traitors? 
Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength, 
Which they upon the adverse faction want. 
Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen, 
Let us survey the vantage of the ground. 
Enter, on the other side of the field, 
RICHMOND. The weary sun hath made a golden set, 
And by the bright tract of his fiery car 
I'll draw the form and model of our battle, 
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment; 
And by the second hour in the morning 
Desire the Earl to see me in my tent. 
South from the mighty power of the King. 
In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold. 
[They withdraw into the tent] 
KING RICHARD. Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk. 
Into the blind cave of eternal night. Exit CATESBY 
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow. 
KING RICHARD. Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord 
RATCLIFF. Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself, 
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers. 
RATCLIFF, about the mid of night come to my tent 
RICHMOND. All comfort that the dark night can afford 
So much for that. The silent hours steal on, 
And flaky darkness breaks within the east. 
In brief, for so the season bids us be, 
Prepare thy battle early in the morning, 
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement 
With best advantage will deceive the time 
Farewell; the leisure and the fearful time 
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love 
The usurping helmets of our adversaries! 
That we may praise Thee in the victory! 
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes. 
Enter the GHOST Of YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD, 
son to HENRY THE SIXTH 
[To RICHMOND] Be cheerful, Richmond; for the wronged 
Enter the GHOST of HENRY THE SIXTH 
Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die. 
Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die. 
Enter the GHOST of CLARENCE 
To-morrow in the battle think on me, 
[To RICHMOND] Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster, 
The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee. 
Enter the GHOSTS of RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN 
Will conquer him. Awake and win the day. 
Enter the GHOST of HASTINGS 
Enter the GHOSTS of the two young PRINCES 
the Tower. 
Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy! 
Enter the GHOST of LADY ANNE, his wife 
To-morrow in the battle think on me, 
Enter the GHOST of BUCKINGHAM 
GHOST. [To RICHARD] The first was I that help'd thee 
to the crown; 
The last was I that felt thy tyranny. 
O, in the battle think on Buckingham, 
[The GHOSTS vanish. RICHARD starts out of his dream] 
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight. 
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree; 
Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree; 
Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!' 
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd 
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard. 
RATCLIFF. Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock 
Hath twice done salutation to the morn; 
KING RICHARD By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night 
Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard 
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers 
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper, 
Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sitting in his tent 
RICHMOND. The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams 
In the remembrance of so fair a dream. 
How far into the morning is it, lords? 
LORDS. Upon the stroke of four. 
The leisure and enforcement of the time 
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls, 
And slaughtered those that were the means to help him; 
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil 
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain; 
Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire; 
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors; 
If you do free your children from the sword, 
Then, in the name of God and all these rights, 
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt 
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face; 
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt 
The least of you shall share his part thereof. 
KING RICHARD. He said the truth; and what said Surrey 
RATCLIFF. He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.' 
KING He was in the right; and so indeed it is. 
Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar. 
Who saw the sun to-day? 
KING RICHARD. Then he disdains to shine; for by the book 
He should have brav'd the east an hour ago. 
KING RICHARD. The sun will not be seen to-day; 
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army. 
I would these dewy tears were from the ground. 
More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven 
NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field. 
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, 
Our archers shall be placed in the midst. 
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse. 
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side 
A thing devised by the enemy. 
Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe. 
They would restrain the one, distain the other. 
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again; 
And, in record, left them the heirs of shame. 
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head! 
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves! 
NORFOLK. My lord, the enemy is pass'd the marsh. 
After the battle let George Stanley die. 
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons! 
Another part of the field 
The King enacts more wonders than a man, 
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death. 
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost. 
And I Will stand the hazard of the die. 
I think there be six Richmonds in the field; 
Another part of the field 
Retreat and flourish. Enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the crown, 
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead. 
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch 
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled 
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament, 
We will unite the white rose and the red. 
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood, 
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son, 
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire; 
The true succeeders of each royal house, 
Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac'd peace, 
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,

Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the 
Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the 
Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are

Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin. 
Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay? 
Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword, 
Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word 
Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues! 
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage

Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets 
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace. 
For this time all the rest depart away. 
Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary 
I drew to part them. In the instant came 
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd; 
He swung about his head and cut the winds, 
Till the Prince came, who parted either part. 
Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun 
Peer'd forth the golden window of the East, 
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore 
That westward rooteth from the city's side, 
And stole into the covert of the wood. 
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew, 
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun 
Should in the farthest East bean to draw 
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed, 
Unless good counsel may the cause remove. 
Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? 
As is the bud bit with an envious worm 
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air 
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. 
Rom. Is the day so young? 
Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; 
She will not stay the siege of loving terms, 
Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes, 
Rom. 'Tis the way 
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair. 
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. 
Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown. 
For men so old as we to keep the peace. 
My child is yet a stranger in the world, 
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years; 
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she; 
She is the hopeful lady of my earth. 
Such as I love; and you among the store, 
When well apparell'd April on the heel 
that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor 
with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter with

And the rank poison of the old will die.

Lucio and the lively Helena.'

Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich 
Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come 
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st; 
With all the admired beauties of Verona. 
Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye

Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun. 
Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile, 
Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year, 
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years; 
Of all the days of the year, upon that day; 
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall. 
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple 
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug! 
Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow, 
For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood, 
For even the day before, she broke her brow;

The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.' 
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd. 
Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme

As all the world- why he's a man of wax. 
Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?

Find written in the margent of his eyes, 
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride 
For fair without the fair within to hide. 
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory, 
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story; 
Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd, my 
young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and 
Juliet, the County stays. 
Ben. The date is out of such prolixity. 
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper; 
After the prompter, for our entrance; 
Being but heavy, I will bear the light. 
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move. 
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me. 
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels; 
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done. 
Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word! 
If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire 
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho! 
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes 
On the forefinger of an alderman, 
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers; 
Her traces, of the smallest spider's web; 
Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams; 
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film; 
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid; 
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub, 
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. 
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, 
That plats the manes of horses in the night 
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs, 
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, 
Which are the children of an idle brain, 
Which is as thin of substance as the air, 
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes 
Even now the frozen bosom of the North 
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, 
Turning his face to the dew-dropping South. 
Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars, 
With this night's revels and expire the term 
But he that hath the steerage of my course 
They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]

to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as 
thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.

Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all. Exeunt.

Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests 
and Gentlewomen to the Maskers. 
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day 
More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up, 
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. 
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, 
Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the hand 
Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! 
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night 
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand 
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave 
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, 
I would not for the wealth of all this town 
It is my will; the which if thou respect, 
Am I the master here, or you? Go to! 
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man! 
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: 
Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took. 
Jul. You kiss by th' book. 
Her mother is the lady of the house. 
Shall have the chinks. 
Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best. 
Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. 
Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio. 
The only son of your great enemy. 
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone. Exeunt.

Alike bewitched by the charm of looks; 
A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard. 
[Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.] 
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; 
When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid! 
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him. 
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, 
To be consorted with the humorous night. 
Blind is his love and best befits the dark. 
Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark. 
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! 
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, 
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, 
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars 
Would through the airy region stream so bright 
Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes 
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds 
And sails upon the bosom of the air. 
Had I it written, I would tear the word. 
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound. 
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, 
And the place death, considering who thou art, 
Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here. 
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea, 
Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face; 
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. 
Which the dark night hath so discovered. 
Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon, 
Which is the god of my idolatry, 
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be 
Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. 
And yet I wish but for the thing I have. 
My bounty is as boundless as the sea, 
My love as deep; the more I give to thee, 
The more I have, for both are infinite. 
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; 
And follow thee my lord throughout the world. 
Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! 
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies, 
Rom. By the hour of nine. 
Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night, 
Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light; 
Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye 
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry, 
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb. 
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies 
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live 
But to the earth some special good doth give; 
Within the infant rind of this small flower 
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. 
And where the worser is predominant, 
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant. 
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet; 
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears, 
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit 
The other did not so. 
Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be? 
Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, 
Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being 
wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the 
very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft; 
Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the 
minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very

Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness! 
Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for thou 
hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, I 
have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?

Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.

The day is hot, the Capulets abroad. 
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring. 
Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the

'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the second

Mer. The fee simple? O simple! 
Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets. 
Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.

villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil 
Rom. I thought all for the best. 
Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally, 
That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds, 
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth. 
This but begins the woe others must end. 
Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again. 
Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again 
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. 
Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death 
I charge thee in the Prince's name obey. 
Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray? 
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. 
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, 
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd 
How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal 
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen 
Cold death aside and with the other sends 
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life 
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die. 
Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague; 
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? 
His fault concludes but what the law should end, 
The life of Tybalt. 
That you shall all repent the loss of mine. 
As Phaeton would whip you to the West 
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night 
And he will make the face of heaven so fine 
That all the world will be in love with night 
And pay no worship to the garish sun. 
O, I have bought the mansion of a love, 
As is the night before some festival 
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords 
Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords. 
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead! 
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice. 
Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes, 
(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast. 
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight. 
Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had! 
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom! 
Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did! 
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend 
Sole monarch of the universal earth. 
Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom 
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom. 
Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom? 
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide. 
Hence banished is banish'd from the world, 
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me. 
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince, 
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, 
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand 
O friar, the damned use that word in hell; 
Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart, 
And fall upon the ground, as I do now, 
Taking the measure of an unmade grave. 
Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans, 
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. Knock. 
Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk. 
Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all. 
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy 
Shot from the deadly level of a gun, 
The hateful mansion. [Draws his dagger.] 
The unreasonable fury of a beast. 
Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth? 
Digressing from the valour of a man; 
Misshapen in the conduct of them both, 
The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend 
But look thou stay not till the watch be set, 
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back 
And bid her hasten all the house to bed, 
Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night 
Either be gone before the watch be set, 
Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence. 
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window. 
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, 
That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear. 
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale. 
Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn; 
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East. 
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. 
It is some meteor that the sun exhales 
And light thee on the way to Mantua. 
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye, 
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow; 
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat 
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads. 
It is the lark that sings so out of tune, 
Some say the lark makes sweet division; 
Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes; 
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day! 
The day is broke; be wary, look about. 
I must hear from thee every day in the hour, 
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb. 
Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend 
Jul. Feeling so the loss, 
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend. 
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him. 
Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives. 
Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands. 
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt 
Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man. 
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman, 
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, 
Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, 
But for the sunset of my brother's son 
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea, 
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is 
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs, 
I would the fool were married to her grave! 
Or never after look me in the face. 
An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets, 
Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds 
That sees into the bottom of my grief? 
Or if you do not, make the bridal bed 
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing 
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth, 
I think it best you married with the County. 
I'll to the friar to know his remedy.

Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short. 
Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind. 
Uneven is the course; I like it not. 
To stop the inundation of her tears, 
Now do you know the reason of this haste. 
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell. 
Jul. The tears have got small victory by that, 
My lord, we must entreat the time alone. 
Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so, 
It strains me past the compass of my wits. 
Shall be the label to another deed, 
Shall play the empire, arbitrating that 
Which the commission of thy years and art 
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, 
From off the battlements of yonder tower, 
Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber. 
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade 
Like death when he shuts up the day of life; 
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes 
Then, as the manner of our country is, 
In thy best robes uncovered on the bier 
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie. 
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake, 
Abate thy valour in the acting it. 
Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin 
Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this. 
Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell 
Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty. 
This is as't should be. Let me see the County. 
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho! 
To move the heavens to smile upon my state, 
And let the nurse this night sit up with you; 
That almost freezes up the heat of life. 
What if it be a poison which the friar 
How if, when I am laid into the tomb, 
I wake before the time that Romeo 
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault, 
The horrible conceit of death and night, 
Together with the terror of the place- 
Where for this many hundred years the bones 
At some hours in the night spirits resort- 
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, 
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud., 
She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains. 
Enter Lady of the House and Nurse. 
Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry. 
Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd, 
The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock. 
Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica; 
Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what. 
And never trouble Peter for the matter. 
The County will be here with music straight, 
Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already: 
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant, 
The County Paris hath set up his rest 
Ay, let the County take you in your bed! 
[Draws aside the curtains.] 
Mother. What is the matter? 
Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day! 
Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead! 
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. 
Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians. 
Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church? 
O son, the night before thy wedding day 
And all the better is it for the maid. 
The most you sought was her promotion, 
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? 
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is, 
And all things change them to the contrary. 
The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill; 
1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. 
Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the

Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep 
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. 
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar? 
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do. 
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar? 
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men! 
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones; 
As I remember, this should be the house. 
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary! 
As will disperse itself through all the veins 
That the life-weary taker mall fall dead, 
And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath 
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

The world affords no law to make thee rich; 
And drink it off, and if you had the strength 
Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John. 
Here in this city visiting the sick, 
And finding him, the searchers of the town, 
Where the infectious pestilence did reign, 
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth, 
The letter was not nice, but full of charge, 
Of dear import; and the neglecting it 
Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone. 
Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets. 
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground. 
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread 
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure. [Retires.] 
The obsequies that I for thee will keep 
The boy gives warning something doth approach. 
Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. 
Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning 
Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee, 
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger 
The time and my intents are savage-wild, 
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea. 
Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth, 
Romeo opens the tomb. 
It is supposed the fair creature died- 
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him. 
Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch. 
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet. [Dies.] 
[Lays him in the tomb.] 
How oft when men are at the point of death 
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath, 
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps 
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars 
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss 
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark! 
It burneth in the Capels' monument. 
Friar. Go with me to the vault. 
The stony entrance of this sepulchre? 
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.] 
Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs. 
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming. 
Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn. 
Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard. 
[Exeunt some of the Watch.] 
Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain; 
Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets; 
Raise up the Montagues; some others search. 
[Exeunt others of the Watch.] 
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie, 
But the true ground of all these piteous woes 
Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar]. 
2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard. 
Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither. 
Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too. 
Enter the Prince [and Attendants]. 
Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,' 
Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain; 
Is empty on the back of Montague, 
Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while, 
Bring forth the parties of suspicion. 
Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least, 
Yet most suspected, as the time and place 
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city; 
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo 
Being the time the potion's force should cease. 
At the prefixed hour of her waking 
But when I came, some minute ere the time 
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. 
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, 
All this I know, and to the marriage 
Unto the rigour of severest law. 
And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault, 
Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it. 
Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch? 
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; 
And then I ran away to call the watch. 
Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words, 
Their course of love, the tidings of her death; 
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.

The pleasant garden of great Italy, 
A merchant of great traffic through the world,

And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study, 
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep, 
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy. 
The mathematics and the metaphysics, 
Before I have a husband for the elder.

For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

And make her bear the penance of her tongue?

I found the effect of love in idleness; 
As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was- 
Affection is not rated from the heart; 
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound. 
TRANIO. Master, you look'd so longly on the maid. 
Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all. 
Such as the daughter of Agenor had, 
When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand. 
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din? 
And with her breath she did perfume the air; 
I pray, awake, sir. If you love the maid, 
That, till the father rid his hands of her,

Here comes the rogue. Sirrah, where have you been? 
Or you stol'n his? or both? Pray, what's the news? 
And therefore frame your manners to the time.

TRANIO. So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after, 
The Presenters above speak 
FIRST SERVANT. My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play. 
And then I know after who comes by the worst.

HORTENSIO. How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio and my 
PETRUCHIO. Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray? 
Then had not Grumio come by the worst. 
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate, 
GRUMIO. Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words 
knock me soundly'? And come you now with 'knocking at the gate'? 
PETRUCHIO. Such wind as scatters young men through the world 
And so am come abroad to see the world. 
As are the swelling Adriatic seas. 
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack. 
GRUMIO. I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O' my 
He hath the jewel of my life in hold, 
Till Katherine the curst have got a husband. 
GRUMIO. Katherine the curst! 
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

HORTENSIO. Peace, Grumio! It is the rival of my love. Petruchio, 
GREMIO. O, very well; I have perus'd the note. 
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca; 
Have I not heard the sea, puff'd up with winds, 
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field, 
And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies? 
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way 
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola? 
BIONDELLO. He that has the two fair daughters; is't he you mean? 
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no? 
TRANIO. Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free 
That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio. 
HORTENSIO. That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio. 
The one as famous for a scolding tongue 
As is the other for beauteous modesty. 
PETRUCHIO. Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by. 
The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for, 
Until the elder sister first be wed. 
The younger then is free, and not before. 
TRANIO. If it be so, sir, that you are the man 
Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest; 
And if you break the ice, and do this feat, 
Achieve the elder, set the younger free

As on a pillory, looking through the lute,

Now must the world point at poor Katherine,

with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with 
the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped

A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.

I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest

As if the vicar meant to cozen him.

And after me, I know, the rout is coming.

As with the meat, some undeserved fault

An ancient angel coming down the hill 
Will serve the turn. 
As if he were the right Vincentio.

To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?

Till you have done your business in the city. 
The patron of my life and liberty.

This, by the way, I let you understand:

GRUMIO. Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little. 
KATHERINA. Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest. 
GRUMIO. Nay, then I will not; you shall have the mustard, 
GRUMIO. Why then the mustard without the beef. 
That feed'st me with the very name of meat.

And so shall mine, before you touch the meat. 
And revel it as bravely as the best,

Lay forth the gown. 
HABERDASHER. Here is the cap your worship did bespeak. 
KATHERINA. I'll have no bigger; this doth fit the time, 
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,

PETRUCHIO. [Aside] Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.- 
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich; 
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds, 
So honour peereth in the meanest habit. 
What, is the jay more precious than the lark 
Or is the adder better than the eel

By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heav'd thence;

Which was, that he, in lieu o' th' premises, 
Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan 
With all the honours on my brother. Whereon, 
Fated to th' purpose, did Antonio open 
The gates of Milan; and, i' th' dead of darkness, 
The ministers for th' purpose hurried thence 
And then I'll bring thee to the present busines 
Which now's upon 's; without the which this story 
So dear the love my people bore me; nor set 
A mark so bloody on the business; but 
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats 
To cry to th' sea, that roar'd to us; to sigh 
To th' winds, whose pity, sighing back again, 
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, 
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. 
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride 
On the curl'd clouds. To thy strong bidding task 
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee? 
I boarded the King's ship; now on the beak, 
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, 
And burn in many places; on the topmast, 
The yards, and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, 
Then meet and join Jove's lightning, the precursors 
O' th' dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary 
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks 
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune 
But felt a fever of the mad, and play'd 
Plung'd in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel, 
Then all afire with me; the King's son, Ferdinand, 
Was the first man that leapt; cried 'Hell is empty, 
And all the devils are here.'

Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs 
In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,

The mariners all under hatches stowed, 
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' th' fleet, 
And are upon the Mediterranean flote 
Supposing that they saw the King's ship wreck'd,

For I am all the subjects that you have,

Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime

Without the walls of Athens 
That girdles in those wolves, dive in the earth 
Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench 
Convert, o' th' instant, green virginity. 
Thy mistress is o' th' brothel. Son of sixteen, 
Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire, 
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth, 
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth, 
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive 
Sow all th' Athenian bosoms, and their crop 
Timon will to the woods, where he shall find 
Th' unkindest beast more kinder than mankind. 
The gods confound- hear me, you good gods all- 
The Athenians both within and out that wall! 
To the whole race of mankind, high and low! 
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods, 
One friend to take his fortune by the arm 
A dedicated beggar to the air, 
And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck, 
Hearing the surges threat. We must all part 
The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you. 
O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us! 
The woods near the sea-shore. Before TIMON'S cave 
Enter TIMON in the woods 
TIMON. O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth 
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb- 
The greater scorns the lesser. Not nature, 
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary, 
The beggar native honour. 
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides, 
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares, 
Is smooth'd by that below. The learned pate 
Ducks to the golden fool. All's oblique; 
Will knit and break religions, bless th' accurs'd, 
Make the hoar leprosy ador'd, place thieves 
With senators on the bench. This is it 
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again- 
She whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores 
Would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices 
To th 'April day again. Come, damn'd earth, 
Among the rout of nations, I will make thee 
TIMON. A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart 
For showing me again the eyes of man! 
With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules. 
TIMON. I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns 
ALCIBIADES. How came the noble Timon to this change? 
TIMON. As the moon does, by wanting light to give. 
But then renew I could not, like the moon; 
promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art man! If thou dost 
TIMANDRA. Is this th' Athenian minion whom the world 
Make use of thy salt hours. Season the slaves 
To the tub-fast and the diet. 
The want whereof doth daily make revolt 
TIMON. The gods confound them all in thy conquest; 
In the sick air; let not thy sword skip one. 
He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron: 
Herself's a bawd. Let not the virgin's cheek 
That through the window bars bore at men's eyes 
Are not within the leaf of pity writ, 
But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe 
Think it a bastard whom the oracle 
ALCIBIADES. Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou givest me, 
Th' immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths; 
With burdens of the dead- some that were hang'd, 
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice, 
Nor sound his quillets shrilly. Hoar the flamen, 
That scolds against the quality of flesh 
And not believes himself. Down with the nose, 
Down with it flat, take the bridge quite away 
Smells from the general weal. Make curl'd-pate ruffians bald, 
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war 
The source of all erection. There's more gold. 
ALCIBIADES. Strike up the drum towards Athens. Farewell, Timon; 
Engenders the black toad and adder blue, 
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm, 
With all th' abhorred births below crisp heaven 
Hath to the marbled mansion all above 
By putting on the cunning of a carper. 
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain, 
That have outliv'd the eagle, page thy heels 
And skip when thou point'st out? Will the cold brook, 
To cure thy o'ernight's surfeit? Call the creatures 
Whose naked natures live in all the spite 
To the conflicting elements expos'd, 
The one is filling still, never complete; 
The other, at high wish. Best state, contentless, 
Worse than the worst, content. 
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords 
To such as may the passive drugs of it 
The icy precepts of respect, but followed 
The sug'red game before thee. But myself, 
Who had the world as my confectionary; 
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men 
Do on the oak, have with one winter's brush 
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men, 
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee, 
That the whole life of Athens were in this! 
APEMANTUS. So I shall mend mine own by th' lack of thine. 
TIMON. The best and truest; 
APEMANTUS. The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the 
thou know'st none, but art despis'd for the contrary. There's a 
APEMANTUS. An th' hadst hated medlars sooner, thou shouldst have 
APEMANTUS. What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to 
TIMON. Women nearest; but men, men are the things themselves. What 
wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in thy 
APEMANTUS. Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men. 
TIMON. Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men, and 
remain a beast with the beasts? 
TIMON. A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t' attain to! 
If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee; if thou wert 
the lamb, the fox would eat thee; if thou wert the fox, the lion 
would suspect thee, when, peradventure, thou wert accus'd by the 
ass. If thou wert the ass, thy dulness would torment thee; and 
still thou liv'dst but as a breakfast to the wolf. If thou wert 
the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou 
shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner. Wert thou the unicorn, 
pride and wrath would confound thee, and make thine own self the 
the horse; wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seiz'd by the 
leopard; wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to the lion, and 
the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life. All thy safety 
mightst have hit upon it here. The commonwealth of Athens is 
TIMON. How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the 
APEMANTUS. Yonder comes a poet and a painter. The plague of company 
APEMANTUS. Thou art the cap of all the fools alive. 
But even the mere necessities upon't. 
Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat 
[Looks at the gold] O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce 
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow 
May have the world in empire! 
But not till I am dead. I'll say th' hast gold. 
Enter the BANDITTI 
fragment, some slender ort of his remainder. The mere want of 
gold and the falling-from of his friends drove him into this 
THIRD BANDIT. Let us make the assay upon him; if he care not for't, 
Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots; 
The oaks bear mast, the briars scarlet hips; 
The bounteous housewife Nature on each bush 
TIMON. Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes; 
Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' th' grape 
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth, 
And so scape hanging. Trust not the physician; 
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction 
Robs the vast sea; the moon's an arrant thief, 
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun; 
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves 
The moon into salt tears; the earth's a thief, 
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power 
FIRST BANDIT. 'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises 
What viler thing upon the earth than friends, 
FLAVIUS. The gods are witness, 
Here, take. The gods, out of my misery, 
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone 
Ere thou relieve the beggar. Give to dogs

and flourish with the highest. Therefore 'tis not amiss we tender 
PAINTER. Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' th' time; 
it opens the eyes of expectation. Performance is ever the duller 
for his act, and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people 
the deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is most 
must be a personating of himself; a satire against the softness 
of prosperity, with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that 
When the day serves, before black-corner'd night, 
TIMON. [Aside] I'll meet you at the turn. What a god's gold, 
'Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam, 
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough- 
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude 
TIMON. Let it go naked: men may see't the better. 
Have travail'd in the great show'r of your gifts, 
Best in all Athens. Th'art indeed the best; 
[To the PAINTER] If, where thou art, two villians shall not be, 
Come not near him. [To the POET] If thou wouldst not reside 
[To the PAINTER] You have work for me; there's payment; hence! 
[To the POET] You are an alchemist; make gold of that.- 
It is our part and promise to th' Athenians 
Men are not still the same; 'twas time and griefs 
Offering the fortunes of his former days, 
The former man may make him. Bring us to him, 
Look out, and speak to friends. Th' Athenians 
Be as a cauterizing to the root o' th' tongue, 
FIRST SENATOR. The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon. 
TIMON. I thank them; and would send them back the plague, 
The senators with one consent of love 
Which now the public body, which doth seldom 
Play the recanter, feeling in itself 
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram; 
And write in thee the figures of their love, 
Surprise me to the very brink of tears. 
The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks, 
Of Alcibiades th' approaches wild, 
Against the walls of Athens. 
And take our goodly aged men by th' beards, 
Giving our holy virgins to the stain 
There's not a whittle in th' unruly camp 
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you 
To the protection of the prosperous gods, 
One that rejoices in the common wreck, 
Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree 
Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe, 
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood, 
The turbulent surge shall cover. Thither come, 
Before the walls of Athens 
MESSENGER. I have spoke the least. 
His fellowship i' th' cause against your city, 
Enter the other SENATORS, from TIMON 
The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring 
Doth choke the air with dust. In, and prepare. 
Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare. Exeunt 
The TIMON's cave, and a rude tomb seen 
Enter a SOLDIER in the woods, seeking TIMON 
SOLDIER. By all description this should be the place. 
I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax. 
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is. Exit 
Before the walls of Athens 
Sound a parley. The SENATORS appear upon the walls 
Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time 
The scope of justice; till now, myself, and such 
As slept within the shadow of your power, 
Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush, 
When crouching marrow, in the bearer strong, 
The common stroke of war. 
Who were the motives that you first went out; 
Which nature loathes- take thou the destin'd tenth, 
And by the hazard of the spotted die 
Let die the spotted. 
Which, in the bluster of thy wrath, must fall 
Approach the fold and cull th' infected forth, 
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress 
Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream

Entomb'd upon the very hem o' th' sea;

Rome and the neighbourhood 
Rome. Before the Capitol 
Flourish. Enter the TRIBUNES and SENATORS aloft; and then enter below 
at the other, with drums and trumpets 
Defend the justice of my cause with arms; 
I am his first born son that was the last 
That ware the imperial diadem of Rome; 
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome, 
Keep then this passage to the Capitol; 
The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate, 
Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS aloft, with the crown 
Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand 
In election for the Roman empery 
Lives not this day within the city walls. 
He by the Senate is accited home, 
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths, 
In coffins from the field; and at this day 
To the monument of that Andronici 
And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths. 
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome, 
And in the Capitol and Senate's right, 
SATURNINUS. How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts. 
And to my fortunes and the people's favour 
Exeunt the soldiers of BASSIANUS 
And to the love and favour of my country 
Commit myself, my person, and the cause. 
Exeunt the soldiers of SATURNINUS 
Open the gates and let me in. 
[Flourish. They go up into the Senate House] 
CAPTAIN. Romans, make way. The good Andronicus, 
Successful in the battles that he fights, 
And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome. 
and then TAMORA the Queen of Goths, with her three 
sons, ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, with AARON the 
the coffin and TITUS speaks 
Lo, as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught 
Returns with precious lading to the bay 
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend! 
Half of the number that King Priam had, 
Behold the poor remains, alive and dead! 
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx? 
[They open the tomb] 
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont, 
LUCIUS. Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths, 
That so the shadows be not unappeas'd, 
TITUS. I give him you- the noblest that survives, 
The eldest son of this distressed queen. 
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed, 
But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets 
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods? 
The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy 
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent 
May favour Tamora, the Queen of Goths- 
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes. 
MUTIUS, the sons of ANDRONICUS, with their swords bloody 
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire, 
Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky. 
[Sound trumpets and lay the coffin in the tomb] 
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart! 
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome! 
Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome, 
And name thee in election for the empire 
But not a sceptre to control the world. 
MARCUS. Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery. 
Rather than rob me of the people's hearts! 
LUCIUS. Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good 
The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves. 
TRIBUNES. To gratify the good Andronicus, 
The people will accept whom he admits. 
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse. 
The wide world's Emperor, do I consecrate 
Receive them then, the tribute that I owe, 
The least of these unspeakable deserts, 
SATURNINUS. [Aside] A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue 
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths. 
TITUS. Traitors, avaunt! Where is the Emperor's guard? 
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away. 
TITUS kills him. During the fray, exeunt SATURNINUS, 
Re-enter aloft the EMPEROR 
with TAMORA and her two Sons, and AARON the Moor 
Traitor, restore Lavinia to the Emperor. 
SATURNINUS. No, Titus, no; the Emperor needs her not, 
That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands. 
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome. 
That, like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs, 
Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome, 
And here I swear by all the Roman gods- 
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome, 
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths, 
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine, 
Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed 
[The BROTHER and the SONS kneel] 
TITUS. Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed. 
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax, 
The dismal'st day is this that e'er I saw, 
Well, bury him, and bury me the next. 
[They put MUTIUS in the tomb] 
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths 
Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell. 
Is she not, then, beholding to the man 
Flourish. Re-enter the EMPEROR, TAMORA 
and her two SONS, with the MOOR, at one door; 
at the other door, BASSIANUS and LAVINIA, with others 
But let the laws of Rome determine all; 
By all the duties that I owe to Rome, 
That, in the rescue of Lavinia, 
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge 
TAMORA. Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend 
Lest, then, the people, and patricians too, 
The cruel father and his traitorous sons, 
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.- 
Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart 
And must advise the Emperor for his good. 
My word and promise to the Emperor 
The Tribune and his nephews kneel for grace. 
I would not part a bachelor from the priest. 
Come, if the Emperor's court can feast two brides, 
To hunt the panther and the hart with me,

Rome. Before the palace 
As when the golden sun salutes the morn, 
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams, 
Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach 
And overlooks the highest-peering hills, 
'Tis not the difference of a year or two 
AARON. [Aside] Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the 
CHIRON. Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have, 
So near the Emperor's palace dare ye draw 
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge: 
The cause were known to them it most concerns; 
Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome. 
Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore, 
Young lords, beware; an should the Empress know 
This discord's ground, the music would not please. 
CHIRON. I care not, I, knew she and all the world: 
I love Lavinia more than all the world. 
What, man! more water glideth by the mill 
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is 
Though Bassianus be the Emperor's brother, 
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose? 
CHIRON. Ay, so the turn were served. 
Must we pursue, and I have found the path. 
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop; 
The forest walks are wide and spacious, 
The Emperor's court is like the house of Fame, 
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears; 
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull. 
DEMETRIUS. Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream 
TITUS. The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey, 
The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green. 
And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride, 
And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter's peal, 
That all the court may echo with the noise. 
To attend the Emperor's person carefully. 
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase, 
And climb the highest promontory top. 
TITUS. And I have horse will follow where the game 
Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain. 
A lonely part of the forest 
[Hides the gold] 
That have their alms out of the Empress' chest. 
Enter TAMORA alone, to the Moor 
The birds chant melody on every bush; 
The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun; 
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind 
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground; 
And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds, 
Replying shrilly to the well-tun'd horns, 
The wand'ring prince and Dido once enjoyed, 
We may, each wreathed in the other's arms, 
Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul, 
This is the day of doom for Bassianus; 
And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll. 
To see the general hunting in this forest? 
Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had, 
With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds 
This valley fits the purpose passing well. 
BASSIANUS. The King my brother shall have notice of this. 
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean, 
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds, 
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven. 
They told me, here, at dead time of the night, 
Unto the body of a dismal yew, 
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms 
TAMORA. Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys, 
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw. 
TAMORA. But when ye have the honey we desire, 
LAVINIA. When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam? 
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble, 
LAVINIA. 'Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark. 
The lion, mov'd with pity, did endure 
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests; 
To save your brother from the sacrifice; 
The worse to her the better lov'd of me. 
The blot and enemy to our general name! 
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him. 
DEMETRIUS throws the body 
of BASSIANUS into the pit; then exeunt 
Till all the Andronici be made away. 
AARON. Come on, my lords, the better foot before; 
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit 
Where I espied the panther fast asleep. 
[Falls into the pit] 
Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall? 
MARTIUS. O brother, with the dismal'st object hurt 
AARON. [Aside] Now will I fetch the King to find them here, 
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise; 
Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks, 
And shows the ragged entrails of this pit; 
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus 
I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb 
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink. 
Enter the EMPEROR and AARON the Moor 
Into this gaping hollow of the earth? 
MARTIUS. The unhappy sons of old Andronicus, 
He and his lady both are at the lodge 
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase; 
TAMORA. Where is my lord the King? 
SATURNINUS. Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound; 
The complot of this timeless tragedy; 
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him. 
Among the nettles at the elder-tree 
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit 
O Tamora! was ever heard the like? 
This is the pit and this the elder-tree. 
Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out 
AARON. My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold. 
Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison; 
Accursed if the fault be prov'd in them- 
Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers; 
Let them not speak a word- the guilt is plain; 
TAMORA. Andronicus, I will entreat the King. 
Another part of the forest 
Enter the Empress' sons, DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, with LAVINIA, 
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe. 
DEMETRIUS. If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord. 
O, that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast, 
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is. 
O, had the monster seen those lily hands 
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them, 
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony 
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet. 
One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,

Enter the JUDGES, TRIBUNES, and SENATORS, with TITUS' two sons 
MARTIUS and QUINTUS bound, passing on the stage to the place of execution, 
For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd, 
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks, 
[ANDRONICUS lieth down, and the judges 
pass by him with the prisoners, and exeunt] 
For these, Tribunes, in the dust I write 
Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite; 
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow 
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death, 
The Tribunes hear you not, no man is by, 
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones; 
Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes, 
For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd 
What fool hath added water to the sea, 
My grief was at the height before thou cam'st, 
Now all the service I require of them 
Is that the one will help to cut the other. 
MARCUS. O, thus I found her straying in the park, 
Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer 
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave, 
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn 
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey dew 
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them. 
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes. 
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long, 
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness, 
Pass the remainder of our hateful days? 
Enter AARON the Moor 
AARON. Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor 
And send it to the King: he for the same 
And that shall be the ransom for their fault. 
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise? 
With all my heart I'll send the Emperor my hand. 
Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn, 
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe, 
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle? 
MARCUS. But I will use the axe. 
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it! 
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth; 
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim 
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds 
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow? 
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad, 
Threat'ning the welkin with his big-swol'n face? 
I am the sea; hark how her sighs do blow. 
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth; 
For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor. 
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons; 
The closing up of our most wretched eyes. 
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head, 
And in this hand the other will I bear. 
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there; 
The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome. 
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen. 
Now will I to the Goths, and raise a pow'r 
Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA, and the boy YOUNG LUCIUS 
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall 
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears. 
Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands? 
To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er 
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands, 
If Marcus did not name the word of hands! 
MARCUS. Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov'd, 
[MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife] 
A deed of death done on the innocent 
And buzz lamenting doings in the air! 
Like to the Empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.

And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens 
Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed. 
Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was, 
Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest. 
TITUS. Soft! So busily she turns the leaves! Help her. 
This is the tragic tale of Philomel 
MARCUS. See, brother, see! Note how she quotes the leaves. 
Forc'd in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? 
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes, 
Unless the gods delight in tragedies?

That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed? 
Without the help of any hand at all. 
That we may know the traitors and the truth! 
[She takes the staff in her mouth 
MARCUS. What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora 
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts, 
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims. 
And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope; 
And swear with me- as, with the woeful fere 
The dam will wake; and if she wind ye once, 
She's with the lion deeply still in league, 
And lay it by. The angry northern wind 
For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome. 
For his ungrateful country done the like. 
Shall carry from me to the Empress' sons 
Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court; 
Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus! Exit 
Rome. The palace 
Enter AARON, DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, at one door; and at the other door, 
CHIRON. Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius; 
BOY. My lords, with all the humbleness I may, 
[Aside] And pray the Roman gods confound you both! 
DEMETRIUS. Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What's the news? 
BOY. [Aside] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news, 
The goodliest weapons of his armoury 
The hope of Rome; for so he bid me say; 
I read it in the grammar long ago. 
Here's no sound jest! The old man hath found their guilt, 
That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick. 
It did me good before the palace gate 
To brave the Tribune in his brother's hearing. 
DEMETRIUS. Come, let us go and pray to all the gods 
AARON. [Aside] Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over. 
DEMETRIUS. Why do the Emperor's trumpets flourish thus? 
CHIRON. Belike, for joy the Emperor hath a son. 
O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor? 
AARON. Why, then she is the devil's dam; 
Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad 
Amongst the fair-fac'd breeders of our clime; 
The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal, 
Accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend! 
NURSE. Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so. 
DEMETRIUS. I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point. 
[Takes the CHILD from the NURSE, and draws] 
Now, by the burning tapers of the sky 
Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war, 
For all the water in the ocean 
Can never turn the swan's black legs to white, 
Although she lave them hourly in the flood. 
Tell the Empress from me I am of age 
The vigour and the picture of my youth. 
This before all the world do I prefer; 
This maugre all the world will I keep safe, 
NURSE. The Emperor in his rage will doom her death. 
AARON. Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears: 
The close enacts and counsels of thy heart! 
Look how the black slave smiles upon the father, 
Nay, he is your brother by the surer side, 
NURSE. Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress? 
Save thou the child, so we may all be safe. 
My son and I will have the wind of you: 
I am a lamb; but if you brave the Moor, 
The chafed boar, the mountain lioness, 
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms. 
But say, again, how many saw the child? 
NURSE. Cornelia the midwife and myself; 
And no one else but the delivered Empress. 
AARON. The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself. 
Two may keep counsel when the third's away: 
Go to the Empress, tell her this I said. [He kills her] 
So cries a pig prepared to the spit. 
Go pack with him, and give the mother gold, 
And tell them both the circumstance of all, 
And be received for the Emperor's heir 
And substituted in the place of mine, 
To calm this tempest whirling in the court; 
And let the Emperor dandle him for his own. 
[Pointing to the NURSE] 
The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms. 
But send the midwife presently to me. 
The midwife and the nurse well made away, 
Then let the ladies tattle what they please. 
CHIRON. Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air 
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, bearing off the dead NURSE 
AARON. Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies, 
And secretly to greet the Empress' friends. 
And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat, 
Exit with the CHILD 
Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters on the ends of them; 
TITUS. Come, Marcus, come; kinsmen, this is the way. 
Go sound the ocean and cast your nets; 
Happily you may catch her in the sea; 
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth; 
What time I threw the people's suffrages 
Join with the Goths, and with revengeful war 
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine. 
I'll dive into the burning lake below 
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels. 
No big-bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops' size; 
But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back, 
We will solicit heaven, and move the gods 
[He gives them the arrows] 
You were as good to shoot against the wind. 
MARCUS. Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court; 
We will afflict the Emperor in his pride. 
MARCUS. My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon; 
MARCUS. This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot, 
The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock 
That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court; 
And who should find them but the Empress' villain? 
She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose 
Enter the CLOWN, with a basket and two pigeons in it 
News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come. 
CLOWN. Ho, the gibbet-maker? He says that he hath taken them down 
again, for the man must not be hang'd till the next week.

Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome! 
What's this but libelling against the Senate, 
Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives. 
Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age, 
Th' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons 
Than prosecute the meanest or the best 
But, Titus, I have touch'd thee to the quick, 
Then is all safe, the anchor in the port. 
TAMORA. Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor. 
[SATURNINUS reads the letter] 
Go drag the villain hither by the hair; 
The Goths have gathered head; and with a power 
Of high resolved men, bent to the spoil, 
SATURNINUS. Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths? 
These tidings nip me, and I hang the head 
'Tis he the common people love so much; 
SATURNINUS. Ay, but the citizens favour Lucius, 
Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it? 
The eagle suffers little birds to sing, 
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings 
Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome. 
I will enchant the old Andronicus 
When as the one is wounded with the bait, 
The other rotted with delicious feed. 
Say that the Emperor requests a parley 
Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting 
Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus. 
And temper him with all the art I have, 
To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.

FIRST GOTH. Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus, 
Led by their master to the flow'red fields, 
ALL THE GOTHS. And as he saith, so say we all with him. 
Upon the wasted building, suddenly 
I made unto the noise, when soon I heard 
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse: 
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white, 
Peace, villain, peace!'- even thus he rates the babe- 
Who, when he knows thou art the Empress' babe, 
To use as you think needful of the man. 
LUCIUS. O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil 
This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress' eye; 
And here's the base fruit of her burning lust. 
AARON. Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood. 
LUCIUS. Too like the sire for ever being good. 
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl- 
A sight to vex the father's soul withal. 
AARON. Lucius, save the child, 
And bear it from me to the Emperess. 
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears, 
AARON. First know thou, I begot him on the Empress. 
Trim sport for them which had the doing of it. 
As sure a card as ever won the set; 
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay; 
I wrote the letter that thy father found, 
And hid the gold within that letter mention'd, 
Confederate with the Queen and her two sons; 
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand, 
I pried me through the crevice of a wall, 
And when I told the Empress of this sport, 
AARON. Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is. 
Even now I curse the day- and yet, I think, 
Few come within the compass of my curse- 
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it; 
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night, 
And bid the owners quench them with their tears. 
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees, 
LUCIUS. Bring down the devil, for he must not die 
Welcome, Aemilius. What's the news from Rome? 
AEMILIUS. Lord Lucius, and you Princes of the Goths, 
The Roman Emperor greets you all by me; 
LUCIUS. Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges 
Is it your trick to make me ope the door, 
Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more. 
Witness the tiring day and heavy night; 
I am Revenge, sent from th' infernal kingdom 
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind 
Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake. 
And whirl along with thee about the globes. 
Even from Hyperion's rising in the east 
Until his very downfall in the sea. 
TITUS. Good Lord, how like the Empress' sons they are! 
And you the Empress! But we worldly men 
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths, 
Or, at the least, make them his enemies. 
How like the Empress and her sons you are! 
For well I wot the Empress never wags 
TITUS. Look round about the wicked streets of Rome, 
Go thou with them; and in the Emperor's court 
I will bring in the Empress and her sons, 
The Emperor himself, and all thy foes; 
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths. 
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;

The one is Murder, and Rape is the other's name;

The basin that receives your guilty blood. 
And of the paste a coffin I will rear, 
Like to the earth, swallow her own increase. 
This is the feast that I have bid her to, 
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on; 
Receive the blood; and when that they are dead, 
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast. 
Now bring them in, for I will play the cook, 
Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies 
The court of TITUS' house 
Enter Lucius, MARCUS, and the GOTHS, with AARON prisoner, 
and his CHILD in the arms of an attendant 
Till he be brought unto the Empress' face

I fear the Emperor means no good to us. 
The venomous malice of my swelling heart! 
The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand.

The feast is ready which the careful Titus

For me, most wretched, to perform the like.

The villain is alive in Titus' house, 
Now have you heard the truth: what say you, Romans?

Troy and the Greek camp before it 
In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece 
The princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd, 
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships 
Fraught with the ministers and instruments 
Their crownets regal from th' Athenian bay 
The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen, 
With wanton Paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel. 
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge 
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch

The Grecian camp. Before AGAMEMNON'S tent 
The ample proposition that hope makes 
Fails in the promis'd largeness; checks and disasters 
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd, 
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap, 
Infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain 
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim, 
And that unbodied figure of the thought 
But the protractive trials of great Jove 
The fineness of which metal is not found 
In fortune's love? For then the bold and coward, 
The wise and fool, the artist and unread, 
The hard and soft, seem all affin'd and kin. 
But in the wind and tempest of her frown 
Puffing at all, winnows the light away; 
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance 
Lies the true proof of men. The sea being smooth, 
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage 
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold 
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut, 
Bounding between the two moist elements 
Like Perseus' horse. Where's then the saucy boat, 
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze 
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind 
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks, 
And flies fled under shade-why, then the thing of courage 
In whom the tempers and the minds of all 
Besides the applause and approbation 
The which, [To AGAMEMNON] most mighty, for thy place and sway, 
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece 
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree 
On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears 
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master, 
The specialty of rule hath been neglected; 
When that the general is not like the hive, 
To whom the foragers shall all repair, 
Th' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask. 
The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre, 
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol 
Amidst the other, whose med'cinable eye 
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil, 
And posts, like the commandment of a king, 
Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets 
What raging of the sea, shaking of earth, 
Commotion in the winds! Frights, changes, horrors, 
The unity and married calm of states 
Which is the ladder of all high designs, 
The enterprise is sick! How could communities, 
The primogenity and due of birth, 
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters 
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores, 
And the rude son should strike his father dead; 
Follows the choking. 
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd 
By him one step below, he by the next, 
Exampl'd by the first pace that is sick 
The fever whereof all our power is sick. 
AGAMEMNON. The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses, 
What is the remedy? 
ULYSSES. The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns 
The sinew and the forehand of our host, 
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day 
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound 
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage- 
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd, 
The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling, 
That's done-as near as the extremest ends 
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age 
Must be the scene of mirth: to cough and spit 
Shake in and out the rivet. And at this sport 
Excitements to the field or speech for truce, 
NESTOR. And in the imitation of these twain- 
Count wisdom as no member of the war, 
But that of hand. The still and mental parts 
Of their observant toil, the enemies' weight- 
So that the ram that batters down the wall, 
For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise, 
They place before his hand that made the engine, 
Or those that with the fineness of their souls 
Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice 
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush 
The youthful Phoebus. 
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon? 
AGAMEMNON. This Troyan scorns us, or the men of Troy 
The worthiness of praise distains his worth, 
If that the prais'd himself bring the praise forth; 
But what the repining enemy commends, 
To set his sense on the attentive bent, 
AGAMEMNON. Speak frankly as the wind; 
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece 
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth 
The splinter of a lance. Even so much. 
As may be in the world. His youth in flood, 
And find the welcome of a noble foe. 
Blunt wedges rive hard knots. The seeded pride 
ULYSSES. This challenge that the gallant Hector sends, 
NESTOR. True. The purpose is perspicuous even as substance 
And, in the publication, make no strain 
ULYSSES. And wake him to the answer, think you? 
For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute 
In this vile action; for the success, 
Of good or bad unto the general; 
The baby figure of the giant mas 
Directive by the limbs. 
And think perchance they'll sell; if not, the lustre 
Of the better yet to show shall show the better, 
By showing the worst first. Do not consent 
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes, 
The sort to fight with Hector. Among ourselves 
Give him allowance for the better man; 
For that will physic the great Myrmidon, 
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off, 
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone. Exeunt

Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray. 
And you an officer fit for the place. 
There, take the paper; see it be return'd;

And would not force the letter to my view! 
Which they would have the profferer construe 'Ay.' 
That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse, 
And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod! 
Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' Love.' 
JULIA. Let's see your song. [LUCETTA withholds the letter] 
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant; 
JULIA. The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass. 
LUCETTA. Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus. 
Here is a coil with protestation! [Tears the letter] 
Go, get you gone; and let the papers lie. 
JULIA. Nay, would I were so ang'red with the same!

Nay, take them. [Gives hack the letter]

PANTHINO. Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in losing 
the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing thy voyage, lose thy 
LAUNCE. Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and the

Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman

For why, the fools are mad if left alone.

How shall I best convey the ladder thither?

Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them, 
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose. 
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car, 
And with thy daring folly burn the world? 
Thank me for this more than for all the favours

And feed upon the shadow of perfection.

How do you, man? The music likes you not.

HOST. Hark, what fine change is in the music!

Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.

For, since the substance of your perfect self

That e'er I watch'd, and the most heaviest. Exeunt

sooner into the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher 
judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four 
gentleman-like dogs under the Duke's table; he had not been 
there, bless the mark, a pissing while but all the chamber smelt 
him. 'Out with the dog' says one; 'What cur is that?' says 
another; 'Whip him out' says the third; 'Hang him up' says the 
Duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it 
was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs. 
'Friend,' quoth I 'you mean to whip the dog.' 'Ay, marry do I' 
quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; "twas I did the

I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath

LAUNCE. Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me. 
LAUNCE. Ay, sir; the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the

own, who is a dog as big as ten of yours, and therefore the gift 
the greater. 
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture. 
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs. 
To hear me speak the message I am sent on. 
This is the letter to your ladyship. 
SILVIA. The more shame for him that he sends it me; 
Though his false finger have profan'd the ring, 
The air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks 
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face, 
Our youth got me to play the woman's part, 
As if the garment had been made for me; 
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,

What's the matter? Look up; speak. 
PROTEUS. How! let me see. Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia. 
This is the ring you sent to Silvia. 
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root! 
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds, 
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all th' sins: 
VALENTINE. Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke. 
Come not within the measure of my wrath; 
DUKE. The more degenerate and base art thou 
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,

When she will take the rein, I let her run; 
A man, the worst about you. 
But first I'll do my errand. The good Queen, 
[Laying down the child] 
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard. 
By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard; 
Tak'st up the Princess by that forced baseness 
The sacred honour of himself, his Queen's, 
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's; and will not- 
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse 
The root of his opinion, which is rotten 
It is the issue of Polixenes. 
Hence with it, and together with the dam 
Commit them to the fire. 
And, might we lay th' old proverb to your charge, 
So like you 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords, 
Although the print be little, the whole matter 
And copy of the father- eye, nose, lip, 
The trick of's frown, his forehead; nay, the valley, 
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek; his smiles;

And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale, 
Which fortified her visage from the sun, 
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw 
The carcase of a beauty spent and done. 
Laund'ring the silken figures in the brine 
As they did batt'ry to the spheres intend; 
To th' orbed earth; sometimes they do extend 
The mind and sight distractedly commixed. 
And, true to bondage, would not break from thence, 
Which she perused, sighed, tore, and gave the flood; 
This said, in top of rage the lines she rents, 
Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew 
The swiftest hours observed as they flew, 
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe. 
'Tis promised in the charity of age. 
The injury of many a blasting hour, 
And every light occasion of the wind 
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind; 
Whose bare out-bragged the web it seemed to wear: 
Proud of subjection, noble by the sway, 
Whether the horse by him became his deed, 
Or he his manage by th' well-doing steed. 
'But quickly on this side the verdict went: 
'So on the tip of his subduing tongue 
To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep, 
He had the dialect and different skill, 
'That he did in the general bosom reign 
Like fools that in th' imagination set 
The goodly objects which abroad they find 
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them. 
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower. 
Of proofs new-bleeding, which remained the foil 
The destined ill she must herself assay? 
To put the by-past perils in her way? 
To be forbod the sweets that seems so good 
The one a palate hath that needs will taste, 
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling; 
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind; 
'"Among the many that mine eyes have seen, 
Or my affection put to th' smallest teen, 
In bloodless white and the encrimsoned mood- 
With the annexions of fair gems enriched, 
'"The diamond? why, 'twas beautiful and hard, 
The deep-green em'rald, in whose fresh regard 
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend 
Of pensived and subdued desires the tender, 
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise; 
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote; 
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove 
The thing we have not, mast'ring what not strives, 
Playing the place which did no form receive, 
The scars of battle scapeth by the flight, 
The accident which brought me to her eye 
Upon the moment did her force subdue, 
And now she would the caged cloister fly. 
The broken bosoms that to me belong 
And sweetens, in the suff'ring pangs it bears, 
The aloes of all forces, shocks and fears. 
To leave the batt'ry that you make 'gainst mine, 
O, how the channel to the stream gave grace! 
Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses 
In the small orb of one particular tear! 
But with the inundation of the eyes 
Could scape the hail of his all-hurting aim, 
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim; 
'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace 
The naked and concealed fiend he covered, 
That th' unexperient gave the tempter place, 
Would yet again betray the fore-betrayed,
